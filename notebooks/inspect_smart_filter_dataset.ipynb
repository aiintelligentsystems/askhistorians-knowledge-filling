We want to make an engine that generates plate tectonics, human language, culture, everything. We want to utilize academic models, automated agents, and tons of other cool stuff.\\n\\nI've been meditating on what a global history simulation with a universal culture &amp; language engine would look like; and how it could be implemented as a game with educational benefits. I outline my vision here:\\n\\nhttp://www.iontom.com/2012/08/25/game-build/\\n\\nAfter receiving a lot of response from the /r/Futurology community, I decided to make a new sub-reddit dedicated to this type of simulation. This is the result, if you have any interest at all please come check it out. Even if all you're able do is provide some good links or examples.\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/simulate\\n\\nI realize a lot of what is being proposed is naive or technologically difficult. This means having a dialogue about the limits of computation when building systems to run these models. Here's one of the parallel computing systems we might want to support:\\n\\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone\\n\\nThanks for your time everyone. Any interest is greatly appreciated! Which groups do you think would be the most interested in something like this? I want to find as much talent as can be thrown at this thing!\\nCheers!\",\n",
