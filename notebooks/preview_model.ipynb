Iron is transported in the blood stream via an iron complex bound to a large protein called transferrin. The iron complex can only bind to transferrin when transferrin has been laden with iron and is referred to as 'loaded iron;' when unloaded, it is referred to as 'free iron.' Because your iron balance is insufficient and the amount of  \n",
