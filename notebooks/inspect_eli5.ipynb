When you're 3 drinks in, you feel it early, and can generally already tell you're starting to feel something. Lets say you then switch to beer. At this point, you have three drinks worth in your blood, and you're adding 3 drinks to your stomach. \\n\\nYour body processes alcohol out at the same rate, no matter what format it's in, so it's already started reducing the alcohol level in your system. Since beer digests slower, and the alcohol is tied up in all the other stuff in the beer, there's a slower release of alcohol from the 3 beers. While that's entering your bloodstream, your body is already eliminating some of the hard alcohol, and you end up having a much softer curve of the amount of alcohol in your blood.\\n\\nNow lets switch it. Drink 3 beers first. The same is still true of the beer, it has to be digested, meaning that the start of the curve is much slower. You're an hour in and still not feeling it yet, so you decide to have three more liquor drinks. Unfortunately, your body hasn't absorbed all the alcohol from the beers yet, and you hit it with another massive spike of readily absorbed alcohol. Suddenly, the level takes a huge jump all at once and your body can't react as well to it. \\n\\nEven after absorbing all of the liquor, it's possible the beer still hasn't fully digested yet, and your BAC will continue to rise, even after you know you're well beyond your tolerance point. Cue possible toxicity. \\n\\nThere are things you can do to mess around with this: Eating starchy foods is one of the biggest. Starchy foods absorb alcohol, meaning that hard alcohol will take longer to absorb, and the spike won't happen as early or strong.\\n\\nOne other aspect to this really is the psychological difference in choices made by people drinking Hard A first (Feeling it early means slowing down to make sure you don't go too far) vs. Beer first (I don't feel it yet, so I should drink more!) and when the BAC curve hits its peak.\",\n",

Your old dad Ventolin_Man knows a thing or two, believe it or not, what with those couple of years of computer engineering I\\'ve got under my belt. so here\\'s the deal: To get real randomness, you have to go out and measure something random, like coin flips or air currents or which girl your bastard uncle Jerry is going to feel up next. Then you use those measurements as your random numbers. But this sucks major donkey dick because what happens if you have to get a million numbers? You flip a million coins and your thumbs fall off, and your uncle ends up in jail. Because this is hard, the only guys who bother with it are secret agents, so they can make secret codes and crazy shit, cause it has to be really random or else those goddamn ruskies and chinese commies are gonna crack the codes and fuck us up. \\n\\nBut some eggheads said, \"Well fuck. We need lots of random numbers cause that\\'s what we get off on, but we don\\'t want to draw numbers out of a hat every time cause the slips get sticky. Let\\'s use **pseudorandom** numbers - almost sort of not actually random numbers - cause getting those *doesn\\'t* suck major donkey dick.\"\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t know exactly what the guys at reddit do, but my guess is they don\\'t like sucking major donkey dick every time some jerk-off hits the random button. So they have an algorithm that spits out a sort of kind of almost random number - probably one based on what time the computer thinks it is - and they take this number and fuck with it until it points to a subreddit, they just link you right to it. \\n\\nNow, the funny part about this is that the faster the pseudorandom algorithm, the less fancy it is. And the less fancy it is, the shittier it will be at giving you almost random numbers. The reddit algorithm has to spit out a number, then fuck with it *and then* link you to a page, and if it takes longer than it takes to link to a normal page, all of the neckbeards and old cat ladies who use reddit will piss their pants about how it fucking takes forever. And then they\\'ll DDOS the shit out of reddit.\\n\\nNow anyways, since you\\'ve been so well behaved, I\\'ll get you a treat at the liquor store.',\n",

At this same time, the IRS says that you can subtract money from the amount you earned depending on different things:\\n\\n- If you have kids, you can take away $$$ per kid\\n- If you own a house, you can take away $$$ for the interest on your mortgage\\n- If you work from home you can take away $$$ for your expenses like electricity and office supplies\\n- If you donated to charity you can take away $$$ for that\\n\\nOn top of this, each person also gets a standard deduction, meaning you can take $$$ right off the bat, but a lot of times you can either do the standard deduction OR the items from the list above.  This is called itemizing. \\n\\nSo, imagine if you owned a house, and had 3 kids, but only made $30,000 last year.  Your standard deduction (that everyone gets) might bring your earnings down from $30,000 to $20,000.  Then, for each kid lets say you can take away $5,000 more (3x$5000=$15,000). That means you have $5,000 in earnings left that can be taxed.  Finally, you paid $5,000 in intrerest in your home for that year, so you take away $5,000 from your earnings.\\n\\nJust like that, you now made $0 taxable dollars as far as the IRS is concerned.  This means you don't owe any taxes, and any taxes you did pay throughout the year will get returned to you.\",\n",

That is because ordinary objects have mass. And in order for an ordinary object to accelerate (get its speed up) to the speed of light, the object would requite an **infinite amount of energy**. That's really all you need to know (but you could always learn the reasons more in-depth if you want to).\\n\\nThere is also the issue of time dilation and length contraction. Say I want to go to a star that is 3 light-years away. (That is a long distance. A light-year is the distance light can travel in a year, around five trillion miles.) If I travel to the star at 99% the speed of light (which is possible), it will take me about 3 years and 1 month to reach the star.\\n\\n**BUT WAIT**. Who says I'm travelling at 99% the speed of light? Who says I'm even moving at all? You could say *relative to the earth and sun* I am moving at 99% the speed of light. But the earth and sun are moving too. So what is my *real* speed? How fast am I *really* moving?\\n\\nAlbert Einstein (ever heard of him?) answered this question. The answer is that there is no real speed. Any measurement of your speed is relative to which reference frame you choose. So there are infinite different speeds you are moving, based on infinite different reference frames you could measure from.\\n\\nSo you are moving at 99% the speed of light relative to the earth, but you are standing still relative to yourself, and you might be moving at 99.5% the speed of light relative tot he star (if the star is also moving towards you).\\n\\n**BUT WAIT** what about that 3 years and 1 month? That measurement was made from earth. From earth's reference, the star is 3 light years away and you are moving at 99% the speed of light. But that's what the earth sees. That's not what you see. You see the earth going away from you at 99% the speed of light and the star coming towards you at 99% the speed of light...\\n\\nHere's the odd part. Because of length contraction, the **distance** you measure to the star is smaller than the distance someone on the earth measures. You measure a smaller distance,about half a light year. So it only takes you about 6 months to get there.\\n\\n**BUT WAIT**. If someone on the earth thinks it took you 3 years to get there, and you think it only took 6 months to get there, who is right? The answer (Einstein again), is that you are both right. You will age 6 months, while 3 years pass on earth.\",\n",

This works for speeds well below the speed of light, and physics has gotten by quite well on it for a long time. However, as you approach the speed of light, funny things happen. Experimental physicists in labs shoot electrons and other small particles with laser beams, and measure their information like speed and mass. They have found that, like 23koala explained, as you go closer to the speed of light, funny things happen. At this point if you push more on your car, only a portion of the energy you applied will make the car go faster, the rest will cause the car\\'s mass to increase.

       " 'answers': [[{'answer_body': 'No one knows by a long shot :) Discovering exactly how is one of humanities holiest of grails!    \\n\\nHere is *part* of the proposed explanation (unproven) I subscribe to:    \\n\\nYour Consciousness is the part of you that is aware of things. It is like an organ, and it\\'s function is the awareness of the *identification of information*.    \\n\\nSensors in your body send sensory information to your brain. These little bits are partly saved. A pixel of \"red\", a dash of \"sound\", or \"depth\". From these, the brain *unites* a whole bunch into \"whole units\", which we can call \"perception\" units. These are saved units that stand for \"whole objects\", a tree or a table for example. Then the brain looks through all the \"perception units\" you have automatically saved and makes \"conceptual units\", and saves those. These conceptual units are created via either a unconscious or conscious effort of \"abstraction\". Essentially, a concept is derived from extracting essential similarities from different specific perceptual units. (E.g. 100 perceptual \"tables\" are all different and specific in height/colour/property values), but the abstracted \"table\" omits the specific measurements/values and only says that a table must have \"a\" height, \"a\" colour). Now you have to imagine a huge hierarchy of information stored in your brain, like a a very complicated tree, of saved units from the simple to the mind-bogglingly abstract.    \\n\\nWhen you open that door, the sensory information travels through your sensors, and your subconciousness/consciousness *identifies it in the tree of information it has already stored*. You can imagine this tree of stored info \"lighting up\" as the identification takes place - first sencepts, then percepts, then concepts. Consciousness is aware of these inner perceptual units and conceptual units \"as identified objects\", the perceptual units as a \"layer\" that overlays each of the sensors, and the conceptual units as either seen, heard etc as an invisible overlay in your imagination.    \\n\\nWhat and How the brain decides to \"find patterns of similarities and differences in\" is vastly complicated. The search and building of your brain occurs in parallel by multiple functions, some that span \"snapshots of time\" and others than span \"strings of events over time\". Some sets of similarities are simply for the identification of physical facts. Others, derived from them and pertaining to resulting pain/pleasure, happiness/sadness, achievement/failure, become a complicated structure of \"evaluations\", for the identification of what is good/bad.    \\n\\n\\nI could talk forever on this, but one last idea; in a sense, a \"whole idea\", or a \"whole sentence\" can be though of as a *single abstract unit* at some level in your brain that needs to be *fleshed out* and given a specific perceptory realness in order that your consciousness can be aware of it. Imagined auditory or visual \"words\" of language are precisely the way an abstraction is given such a visual/auditory \"handle\". You might have millions of unworded ideas that you can\\'t be consciously aware of unless you endow those ideas *with* a handle, with a words or words, to bring them up from the subconscious to the conscious. Otherwise, you\\'ll just \"feel\" those ideas as an unworded hunch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   {'answer_body': 'The answer you are looking for is the combination of your culture and your body.\\n\\nYour brain puts together information from your body, and from its culture. This information is collected and stored in the brain as symbols. Symbols are are given meaning throughgroup interaction, and later, personal experience. \\n\\nFor example, your skin sends signals to your brain, telling it whether it is hot or cold. Your skin could also tell the brain if it is experiencing pain or pleasure. \\n\\nThese signals are taken by the brain, and are turned into symbols. These symbols were acquired through growing up around your friends, family, and school - typically at a young age. Your culture gives a name to these symbols.  They are so important for your understanding of the world, that they are seemingly recalled in a natural way. But, with a few notable exceptions, like fight or flight, they aren\\'t.\\n\\nAfter a time, the brain develops the potential to differentiate between how much pain (acceptable / not) or how much pleasure (good vs heavenly). The ability to distinguish between the intensity of the sensation from your skin allows for additional symbols to be created, and to have meaning for you.\\n\\nOnce your brain provides you with the proper symbol for the sensation, culture takes over. This is the development of language, which provides you with the little voice inside of your head. Ideally, it allows you to share the meaning of these symbols with other people - \"Man, its cold today!\" and potentially devise actions to solve the problem the skin tells you about. \"Man, its cold today! Does anyone have a sweater I could borrow?\"\\n\\nThus, we can see how the appropriate response to this physical reaction -> symbol was taught. \\n\\nMembers of a culture typically reward individuals that  act in accordance with socially appropriate responses (or they aren\\'t punished for their transgressions). Aka they get treats for good behavior or avoid punishment for bad behavior. This encourages a sharing of symbols, and indicates to everyone involved what actions those symbols ought to be accompanied with.',\n",

They don\\'t just look things up that are filed under A, B, C, they link loads and loads of memories together which means when you feel something that makes you think \"it\\'s cold\" it\\'s because you remember so strongly being cold and all that that means from times when you have been cold before.

How do we know who is telling the truth and who is not?\\n\\nUnfortunately, we have no way of knowing who is really lying or what really happened.  The only way to do this is to hear all the evidence and then try to figure out if it did.\\n\\nThere are many ideas at work.\\n\\nThe first is that people are innocent until they are proven to be guilty of doing that bad thing.\\nIf you accuse someone, you always have to prove it.  Otherwise you are free to make any accusations as you wish.  It is unfair to have to prove your own innocence.\\n\\nThe second is that everyone should have a fair trial. This means that you and the person who accuses you will have a chance before another, independent person for that person to determine if you really did do that bad thing.  Your accuser will have to put all evidence before the judge and the judge will determine if it is enough to prove you did that bad thing.\\n\\nAs to whether lawyers feel bad?  the idea is that lawyers, as professionals, have a duty to act in their client's best interest. However, lawyers are people.  They do have personal feelings, but they won't let that get in the way.  They know that they are part of the legal system and they must put their personal feelings aside in order to uphold that system.   In fact, it isn't their job to decide or judge; their job is to simply give legal advice and represent their client before the Court and the Judge to the best of their ability.  It doesn't matter what he or she feels about that client; it is their duty and a rule to defend that person even if he or she hates that person.  If he or she can't do this, then they shouldn't be lawyers in the first place.\\n\\nA lawyer may indeed help a murderer go free.  But this isn't entirely the lawyer's fault at all.  The people who accused him failed to do their jobs properly.  The lawyer and the judge did theirs properly.  In the end, it is a question of whether it is better to let ten guilty people go free than let one innocent person found guilty.\\n\\nSo back to suppose someone accused you of something really terrible.  How would you want things to be done then? do you ever want someone who is supposed to help you not do so because they thought what you did was bad? what if it was because they didn't like your name? or the color of your eyes?

It's not fun to be outside playing and not feel safe.  \\n\\nSo everybody in the city chips in a little bit and we hire a lawyer.  The whole lot of us.  She's our lawyer. Her name is Polly Prosecutor. Polly's job is to make sure those bad people who have done horrible things go to jail where they can't hurt anyone else.  Did I mention she's really smart and studied really hard and is really good at her job?  Cause she is.  \\n\\nSo our bad guy, let's call him Bruno, does some bad stuff.  Bruno get's arrested and has to go see a judge to explain himself.  Our lawyer, Polly, is gonna be there too.  She's gonna use all her smarts to make sure he goes to jail for a long time.  Bruno isn't very smart.  Afterall, he did bad stuff.  Polly would run circles around him and he might go away forever.  \\n\\nBut what if it was all a misunderstanding? An accident? What if someone is telling a lie about Bruno?  Maybe he's sick in the head and needs something different than jail? Bruno may not be smart enough to explain to the judge what went wrong.  It wouldn't be fair if all of us got to have our lawyer there, but Bruno couldn't have his lawyer there.  \\n\\nSo just to be fair, Bruno gets a lawyer.  Heck, we'll even pay for it! His name is Dan Defender.  He's a lawyer just like Polly.  Polly and Dan might seem like really different people, but when they became lawyers they both promised to fight as hard as they possibly could for the people they were working for.  Dan is really interested in making sure that Bruno gets treated fairly and does his best to explain the situation.  \\n\\nSometimes Polly gets a little carried away and she might start overdoing it.  She'd never lie, but she may get really excited about asking the judge to put bad people in jail.  That doesn't sit well with Dan.  He doesn't think that jail is the best option for everyone and so even though it might be true that Bruno did some bad stuff, he's really determined to make sure he doesn't go to jail forever and ever just because Polly got excited.  \\n\\nDoes Dan feel bad about helping out Bruno?  Heck no!  He's really proud of himself.  He knows that he did his best to help out and make sure a bad situation doesn't get worse.  \\n\\nSo what about if Bruno tells Dan he did it?  Well nothing changes.  The promise Dan took when he became a lawyer stays the same.  He's gonna do his best.  Just like Polly, he can't lie, but he'll do his best to make sure that Bruno gets treated fairly.  Even if Dan knows what really happened, it's not his job to put Bruno in jail.  He has one job - be the best lawyer for Bruno that he can be.  Putting Bruno in jail is up to the judge and jury to decide, not Dan or Polly.  \\n\\nAnd that's why some lawyers help bad people.    \",\n",

A few reasons. \\n\\nOne, while you know someone deserves to get punished, the severity of the punishment can still be debated. If someone is a murder you could still argue that he deserves life in prison and not the death penalty. \\n\\nTwo, you can defend a person's legal rights without defending the person. If prosecutors and police officers know that a defense attorney will always make the government follow the law or lose a conviction, then the government is more likely to follow the law when dealing with innocent people. \\n\\nCan you imagine the difference it would make if the police knew that a defense attorney would not defend a guilty client? The police could simply search every person without suspicion and only bring the guilty to trial. Those guilty would then get convicted and the police would have no incentive not to search people at random. \\n\\nTL;DR: Defense attorneys do not defend people, they defend the law. \\n\",\n",

There are lots and lots of settings that determine what gets thrown out and when.  If you use transcoding software like handbrake with the default settings, the converted video will look good, but it won't be all that small.  You can start playing around with these settings, but unless you know what you're doing, the video may come out even bigger or it might look bad.  It takes practice and effort to know what to change for what types of movies.\\n\\nTo get *really* small (under 1.5GB) 720p rips that actually look good, you need to adjust these settings not just for the whole film, but from scene to scene.  This requires a lot of work, and getting it right is almost an art.  But no matter how good someone is at it, the h.264 codec is still not perfect and you're still throwing things out to make the video small.  Some people are more sensitive to the distortions caused by this extra compression.  You may not notice the difference (or at least not enough to ruin the experience), but others might.  So between the effort involved and some people still not liking these super-compressed rips, they're not very common.\\n\\nBut there is hope.  The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has [recently finalized the specifications]([LINK] for a new, better compression scheme called h.265.  It is said to be twice as efficient as the current popular codec, so in the future, visually-identical 720p videos can really be half the size they are now without all the effort that is currently required.\",\n",

An uncompressed 720p movie takes up 530311 kbps for just the video.

For 720p, that means throwing away *tons* of high frequency details. The picture appears smoothed, natural grain in the original becomes dancing distortion, and you're only saved from terrible blocking by the deblocking filter (meaning further smoothing). It's still watchable; you can still tell what's happening, but you're not really getting an HD picture by any standard other than the resolution.

Data compression can roughly be divided into two categories. There's the lossless compression and the lossy compression.\\n\\nLossless compression is compression where you get exactly the original content after you uncompress the data. If you compress any program files, they will be compressed using a lossless compression because even the slightest difference in a program file will cause the program to malfunction. \\n\\nLossy compression is compression where you accept that after uncompressing the file, the result may not be exactly what it was before. This is fine for things like video and audio where people probably won't notice if there is a tiny difference to the original. We're talking things like the shade red at some small part of the screen being a bit wrong. In general, you can compress things much more with lossy compression so pretty much all video is compressed with it. Lossless compression simply doesn't compress the video enough.\\n\\nOne obvious thing that affects the file size and quality is bitrate. It's how many bits of data there is per one second of video. If you can have more bits per second of video then you can include more details in the picture. So maybe the 5.5 GB file had a much bigger bitrate. But that's not the only thing that affects quality and file size.\\n\\nOften with compression, especially lossy compression, there isn't one correct way to do it. Even if the file type is the same and the codec is the same and the bitrate is the same, you can get two very different files from the same source material. The encoder that does the compression does some guesswork in what details it can throw away from the picture in order to get a better compression ratio but without affecting the resulting picture too much. Different encoders may very well do this differently. In general, the encoders also have a lot of settings that the user may fine tune. So if you have a bad encoder or one where the settings aren't tweaked very well then it may need to use a much higher bitrate in order to achieve a similar quality. \\n\",\n",

Specifically:\\n\\nSource quality + resolution -> Encoding algorithm -> Encoder settings -> Output bitrate + resolution\\n\\nA high quality source means generally less \"noise\" and a more efficient encode.  Source resolution determines the number of pixels, which gives a crisper/larger picture but increases filesize.\\n\\nThe encoding algorithm determines, generally speaking, how efficient the encoding is.  Generally speaking, more modern encoders are more efficient/smarter than older encoders.\\n\\nThe settings on the encoder also affect the efficiency of the encoding - these are the expertise that the user puts in, and can cause a large amount of difference.\\n\\nThe output bitrate and resolution both directly affect the filesize, and together the quality (lower resolution + higher bitrate = higher quality picture, for example).\\n\\nThus you can see there are a number of contributing factors - a smaller size rip might look better if the larger size rip uses an old encoder, poor settings, and has poor source material.  However, if you have good source, good encoding, high bitrate etc, you\\'re going to typically end up with a largeish file that looks awesome.',\n",

This makes sound go in every direction (like how you can hear music when you are behind speakers), but this decreases the volume as the distance from the source is increased.

Similarly, sounds from behind you are slightly muffled (because they must pass through your outer ear before reaching the ear canal. This difference helps us determine which sounds are coming from behind and in front of us.',\n",

Now apply Huygen\\'s Principle to a sound waves moving past you, and you\\'ll find your answer.\\nThe answer is called \"Defraction\" Simply put, it is how a  wave \"bends\" around obstacles in its path.

The only place in the US that does have good train coverage is Northeast, where Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Washington are close enough that they can have reasonable train coverage.\\n\\nShort train rides are competitive with flights, since you don't have the hassle of going all the way out to an airport and going through airport security.  There is much less demand for train rides of more than a few hours, since at that point it would be much faster to just fly.  Only tourists want to take train rides of more than 4 hours.  And if you look at the 20 or so largest US cities, almost all of the train rides between them would be more than that, even with high speed trains.  Except for the Northeast cities I mentioned, there would only be a few other city pairs where a train would be competitive with flying, like Los Angeles - San Francisco, or Houston - Dallas.  And routes like Houston-Dallas or Chicago-Detroit wouldn't have much interest from tourists.\\n\\n-Far more Americans own and use cars than Europeans or Japanese, and most Americans are more likely to just drive short trips like Houston-Austin in their own cars rather than pay for a train ride.\\n\\n-Most US cities have terrible public transportation, so even if you could take a train to somewhere like Houston, you'd have no good way to get around once you are there.  There would be no point to taking trains from city to city and just having to rent a car in each of the cities.\",\n",
