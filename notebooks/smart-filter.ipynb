       " [{'answer_body': 'To answer the questions on Ethics, you need to ask if Dresden was a legitimate target.  My answer is yes, Dresden was a legitimate target.  It was at the time the major rail cross-roads for German troops heading to the Eastern Front (In the briefings, many RAF crews were told that the bombing was at the behest of the Russians) as well as one potential north-south escape route that may be utilized as a part of a guerilla campaign.  Dresden was also known to have an industry revolving around high-precision glass, such as that used in telescopic sights (e.g. sniper rifles) and bomb sights for aircraft.  I have also heard some rumours that Dresden was linked to making ceramic parts in furnaces, like those used in death camps... So Dresden was a legitimate target.\\n\\nHaving determined that it was a legitimate target, there was no reason to not attack it.  In terms of tactics, you have to keep in mind that the best way to protect bomber crews from flak was to put as many aircraft over the target as possible, which make it impossible to hit an individual building, so it was more common for an industrial area of a city to be targeted.  In order to maximise damage, the aircraft involved were loaded with a combination of 4000lb \"cookie\" bombs (high blast) and incendiary bombs.  This was to ensure that the target was destroyed by burning it.\\n\\nIn terms of targeting morale, Operation Thunderclap (as the bombing of Dresden was called) was arranged so that the civilian population would see the might of the Allied airforces.  The USAAF was supposed to attack in daylight on Feb. 13th, targeting the rail yards, with the RAF coming back that night to hit the same target; whilst the USAAF and RAF were due to come back the next day to finish the job.  Churchill has been quite vocal about such a heavy attack for quite a while, although he was very quick to back off his support when voices were raised in protest.\\n\\nTL;DR: Dresden was a military target attacked for mainly military means.  Churchill called for such an attack only to back away and condemn the attack only after public opinion swung against it.',\n",

The allied bombing of Germany - in particular that of Bomber Command - brought massive death and destruction to Germans, destroyed priceless artifacts built and preserved for centuries, yet made little contribution to actually winning the war.\\n\\nThe author makes no excuses for Germany and, from time to time in passing, acknowledges both the evil done by Germans and that the Germans themselves were the pioneers in bombing defenseless cities. The author fully admits that the Germans would have eagerly done worse with bombers - if they had had the power.\\n\\nThe author's point is that the Germans did not have the power. By late 1944, when the war's outcome was no longer in doubt and the destruction began in earnest, they were so totally over-matched by the allies so as to be at the mercy of the bombers. And the bombers showed no mercy, just as readily destroying libraries and the medieval churches of anti-Nazis as factories and the homes of war workers. Showing no discrimination, the bombers killed soldiers and Nazis as readily as they killed children, slave workers and little old ladies.\\nThe author appears grateful that the allies won the war, but in so doing wishes that the bombers' indiscriminate killing and destruction had been tempered. How, he does not say. If nothing else, he wishes to make the reader feel, in a deep visceral way, the destruction sown by the bombers and recognize the tragedy.
