Are there philosophers who believed the “savages” of Africa were, in a very meaningful way, identical to the aristocracy of Europe?\\n\\nI feel like maybe Jesus Christ—to the extent he was an actual person who actually held beliefs and taught them to people—is one of the only figures I’m familiar with who taught something like that before 1700. But as far as secular philosophers go, I’m not familiar with any, and I am interested to know of any.',\n",

Neither are the position that all races are just superficial variations — that sort of requires Darwin to really get to that point, much later. Instead one finds either an advocacy of Biblical monogenism as applied to questions of what we would today call race, or one finds the discussions of the ways in which apparent \"savages\" are in fact culturally equivalent to Europeans. \\n\\nOn the former point, one of the earliest questions that Enlightenment Europeans concerned with taxonomy and geographic diversity asked about human beings was whether they were all essentially the same species or whether they were all different. One sees this is Linnaeus and Buffon and much later in Agassiz. The pre-Darwinian version of this debate was about monogenism versus polygenism, or whether all humans are descended from a single pair of ancestors (as in the Adam and Eve story in Genesis) or whether different geographically distant humans are acts of separate creation. The former tended to be coded as a literally Biblical approach and the latter as a \"scientific\" approach that understood the Bible was not a literal account, somewhat ironically. There were several 17th century advocates of the idea of monogenism, including Robert Boyle. In general this debate did not, as I understand it, heat up until the 19th century, though (and Darwin\\'s work contributed to this argument — Darwin created a \"scientific\" monogenic argument).\\n\\nThe other thread is more common in the 18th century: inquiries in the nature of \"savages,\" trying to figure out if they are really that different from \"civilized\" peoples, or if it was just a matter of what they were used to. One of the key sources of discourage for the Enlightenment were critiques of European societies processed through the lens of external viewpoints (whether indigenous or Asian or what have you). Fitting your timeline, Michel de Montaigne\\'s 1580 essay _On Cannibals_ essentially argues that Amazonian tribesmen were not essentially different, culturally or morally, from 16th-century Europeans who regularly engaged in torture and other practices he found abhorrent. This is not framed in terms of \"race\" — it is framed in terms of barbarism vs. civilization — but you can see how this debate also ends up having a \"biological\" component over time. (And, again, became a major issue for later 19th-century  theorists like Darwin, who also argued that culture was essentially malleable.) \\n\\nSo the above is not nearly any kind of complete answer, and you are right that such writings are fewer and farther between than the writings of those who found ways to justify European (and American) enslavement, extermination, suppression, etc., of non-Europeans in such topics.\\n\\nThis is an utterly later time period than you are asking about, but Stocking\\'s _Victorian Anthropology_ is an extremely useful resource on pre-Darwinian debates on both of these topics.',\n",

They thought about *peoples*, and described their various customs, dress, food, weapons etc. Greeks thought in terms Greeks vs most else (Barbarians). Greeks did think they are in some ways superior to most others. Jews likewise -- they were \"the chosen people\", everyone else wasn\\'t.

For example, phrenology was an attempt to connect bumps on the skull to various mental characteristics. There was also a lot of 19th century literature where shape of nose, chin, relative length of fingers etc was supposedly connected to much else. People with red hair were often associated with violence or negative characteristics. There seems to be an obsession with measurable physical characteristics peaking in the 19th century.',\n",

       " 'Zephyr-History-7600': ' The most famous example of this is Girolamo Savonarola. He was an Italian priest and a prominent political and social reformer. He preached a message of moral and religious purity: he believed in forcing all Italians to convert to their Catholic religion, purge their cities of heretics (specifically Jews and heretical aristocrats) and to convert their souls to a rigorous religious life. Most importantly, he preached that the only way a man could save his soul was to practice holy war against the Turks and the French invasion of Piedmont.\\n\\nNow, Girolamo was far from purified. He was eventually burned at the stake for treason (he betrayed Milan to the French and contradicted the Pope). Characteristically, he said that every purification was ultimately holy war against the infidel (no different from the true Christian war against the infidel). This is basically the idea that every European Christian was a small, sinful infant with his soul destined for damnation until saved by holy war. How did he prove himself wrong? Unfortunately, he was a heretic in the end since he was indeed not a martyr. In reality, his war against France simply meant the unstoppable conquest of Italian territories (which had a large Jewish population) by the French troops, which included small auxiliary armies provided by saveonarola and Piedmont. René Descartes was a later follower of Girolamo, and he discounted the pernicious theory of predestination. No one today believes that the doctrine of predestination should be the principal aspect of Christian doctrine although the doctrine lingers – at least in a weaker and less revisionist form. The true bad news for any civil right-wingers concerned about current political currents is that modern sociologists study the idea of black power.\\n\\nBasic skeptics look at the idea that non-white races have been historically downtrodden by whitemale imperialism. Although the idea is not important but it is found in some dissident schools of thought.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no one conglomerate philospher behind the predestination idea.\\n\\n[Photograph of Girolamo Savonarola in prison about 1492]([LINK]\\n\\n'}"

       "      <td>1. You're thinking of the Palestinian exodus (Al-Nakba), which traditionally refers to the removal of roughly 750,000 Palestinians from the newly created State of Israel between 1947 and 1949, overlapping with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Prior to this, and in contrast, \"Arabic-speaking Jews\" were widespread across the Middle East.\\n2. The Jewish communities in the Arab world were dissolving as a result of both increasing persecution and retaliation that followed the Arab League's passage of the 1948 Palestinian Against Jews Law (‎القانون العربي للغش باليهود‎).\\n3. The law was passed by the Arab League in Cairo on September 11, 1948, and called for the expulsion of all Jews from Arab lands. The League's president at the time, Saudi's King Abdulaziz, abstained from voting, but the rest of the members voted in favour (Syria was absent). A few months prior, the Great Sabra and Shatila Massacre took place in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon underscoring particularly brutal Arab anti-Semitism (that is, Jew-hatred).\\n4. The 1967 Arab-Israeli War, also known as the Six-Day War, may be of particular interest to you. Many more Jews fled or were ejected from Arab countries after this war, in light of both barbaric Arab hatred and retaliation against Israel's defeat of the Arab armies trying to destroy her.\\n5. Regarding your second question, the Arab League officially declared a boycott of the Jewish state as early as 1945. This meant that no Arab country must engage in trading, commerce, or any other relationship with Israeli businesses or individuals. This then intensifying into abolishing citizenship of Jews who could not renounce their allegiance to Israel.** With notable exceptions, this church-state prohibition (which had no formal sanctions or penalties) remained in effect in most Arab League countries until around 1970.*\\n6. How did Arab leaders view their Jewish communities prior to the Arab League's call for their departure or eradication? This constitutes an interesting inquiry, relating to the reasons behind the Arab countries' loss of their Judaic heritage, which is still being addressed. One is encouraged to read: \"The Jews of Arabia: A History of poverty, Power, and Prejudice\" by Noah Patinkin. For a vivid discussion about the state of affairs at the end of the Ottoman era, I recommend the essay by Bernard Lewis in the previously mentioned \"When Muslim and Jews Were Allies\".\\nThis entry was posted in antisemitism, Arabs, history, Israel, jewish, Middle East, Muslims, news and tagged al-nakba, Arab League, jewish diaspora, jewish refugees, jewish tragedies, jewelry, jews, mizrahi jews, palestinians, propaganda. Bookmark the permalink.\\n* All pre-1948 Jewish communities (whether Orthodox or Reform) who lived in what is now Israel's state were ejected from their homes, resulting in the expulsion of 80% of the Palestine's Jewish population (approximately 690,000) during the run-up to the creation of the Israeli state. This story is explained in Professor Efraim Karsh's fabulous book Empire of the Mans: The Rise and Fall of Sha'ol-Sinet (Routledge, 2018).\\n** For a superb summary of the Arab legitimation of de facto Apartheid implemented against Israeli Arabs, Jewish refugees displaced during the Arab wars against Israel (1948-1973), and Jewish settlers allotted to Judea and Samaria, I highly recommend the article by Efraim Karsh which appeared in the Jerusalem Post (July 20, 2018). The author maps the absurd condition of post-Holocaust ethno-religious cleansing which oppresses and excludes Jewish refugees and their descendants who were expelled from their ancestral homes inside unlawfully</td>\n",

       "      <td>Part 1:\\n\\nThere was a mixture of both, in truth. Some Arab governments reversed course, and the overall migration of Jews out of Arab states was quite diverse and remains quite controversial; not least because the property, belongings, and land stripped from them totaled over $100 billion in today's dollars, according to one group advocating today for them to be compensated (though of course, that group has a bias).\\n\\nThe primary Jewish exodus you're thinking of took place in the few years following the end of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, when the Jewish population of Israel virtually doubled in 3 years. Many of those Jews came from European countries, but a healthy chunk came from the Arab world too, with most measures placing Iraqi immigrants as the largest group (over 130,000).\\n\\nArab governments were dealing with multiple conflicting goals when considering Jewish attempts to flee. On the one hand, while certainly not democratic, they also knew that a breakdown of public order and attacks on their Jewish citizenry could harm the stability of the state, as well as their relations with other countries. More importantly, they were also aware that this could spur even more emigration, which brings me to the second conflict: if Jews were *allowed* to leave, and chose to, then they might go to Israel and subsequently strengthen Israel, by enhancing its Jewish population. After all, by the end of the war, Israel was a state with no more than roughly 700,000 Jews and 150,000 Arab Muslim or Christian citizens, which was not an overwhelming disparity, particularly while surrounded by far more populous Arab states. Fleeing Jews would potentially give the state trouble in terms of accommodation, though, if they arrived penniless. So many Arab states went with the option of reversing initial decisions to forbid emigration (or to try to force it), and instead simply said that any Jew seeking to leave would have their property seized and would have to turn over any valuables before leaving.\\n\\nIraq, for example, initially barred Jews from fleeing the country to Israel for fear that it would strengthen Israel. This was what most Arab states chose to do, initially. But by 1950, they decided they would allow Jews to leave, but only if they agreed to lose their citizenship and only if they turned over all valuables. Jewish property could significantly help the Iraqi government's cashflow, and they were happy to seize it all. At that point of course, the Iraqi government went full reversal, and began encouraging Jews to leave in earnest, hoping to take their property for itself. Further, if a Jew declared intent to leave, they had to surrender their citizenship immediately, before they actually left; so many, while waiting to leave, were effectively stateless and in some cases in 1951, were also blocked from using any of their property. Within two years, a policy of forbidding Jewish emigration to Israel turned into a breakneck attempt to push them out quickly. This encouragement was hastened by bombs that, at least in part, may have been planted by Israeli agents targeting Jews to inspire them to flee. However, whether or not that is the case is quite unclear; it is hard to know if Iraq was lying when it hung the \"Zionist agents\" they held responsible for the bombings, given previous bombings had also targeted Jews and were not committed by accused Israeli agents. Inquiries in Israel have yielded no answers on who these accused agents of Mossad actually were, and if they indeed worked for the Mossad.\\n\\nIraq's case is exceptional because of the pure volume and haste with which Jews departed. Given they could only begin leaving in early 1950, it is incredible that by 1952, more than 120,000 Jews fled Iraq, and managed to do so in large part through airlifts by Israel. In 1952, Iraq reversed course *again* and re-banned Jewish emigration, following the alleged Mossad bombings, but barely 10,000 Jews remained in Iraq; more than 90% of Jews had already fled from a country with a formerly quite large and long-established Jewish community.\\n\\nIn Yemen, the situation was not much different. Yemen had roughly 50,000 Jews by 1948, and was a country with an established Jewish community. Similarly to Iraq, Israel was willing to encourage Jews to leave, and many wanted to. Riots targeted Jews in 1947 and onwards, and persecution was quite common. The Yemeni government was quite harsh to Jews already; it leveled high taxes on them generally, but also implemented policies in the early 1900s like the infamous \"orphan's law\", which said that any Jewish orphan would be forced to convert to Islam, taken from any extended family, and fostered by a Muslim family. Israel, with the agreement of the Yemeni leadership, began airlifting Yemeni Jews out of Yemen quite early in what was dubbed \"Operation Magic Carpet\", and more than 90% of that country's Jews left as well. Alaska Airlines made more than 400 flights to and from Yemen to ferry Jews to Israel. The Yemeni government did not have strong objections to this, and as I said, agreed to the plan to let the Jews leave.\\n\\nSyria was slightly different. The Syrian leadership that heralded most of the Jews leaving was actually installed in a CIA-backed coup in 1949, right as the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab world were being finalized. In fact, the armistice agreement between Israel and Syria was not finalized until after the CIA-backed coup had occurred, and negotiations didn't even formally begin until a month post-coup. Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian army's chief of staff, took power in March 1949. He inherited a state  where, as in other Arab states, riots against Jews were increasing in frequency, and where prior policy had been to kill any Jew caught trying to emigrate to Israel. Jews were also forbidden from numerous businesses, and faced restrictions on property. While Zaim allowed Jews to emigrate, he was only in power for around 4 months, and so most of the Jews who fled Syria had to do so secretly and at great risk to themselves. As the years went on, more and more restrictions were placed on Jews, from freezing their bank accounts to restricting their ability to travel to seizing their passports, all in an attempt to prevent them from fleeing to Israel. Only around 5,000 of the more than 30,000 Jews in Syria in 1949 managed to flee to Israel during Zaim's short-lived regime, and so Syrian Jews left in more of a trickle over the coming decades than in a wave.\\n\\nJordan and the West Bank didn't have many Jews to begin with, but what few Jews remained largely fled after 1948. In the case of eastern Jerusalem, roughly 2,000 were expelled when Jewish forces fighting there surrendered. The same occurred in other areas where Jews were fighting in the West Bank.\\n\\nEgypt was another source of Jewish immigrants, with over 70,000 by some measures. Egyptian riots and bombings of Jewish areas also grew in frequency and intensity after 1948. More than 2,000 Jews were arrested, and many more had their property confiscated by the government, which accused them all of being \"Zionist agents\". By 1951, about half had fled Egypt to Israel. Egypt, too, advocated in 1950 for a ban on all Jewish emigration from Arab states, but this did not stop Jews from fleeing on their own. In 1954, Mossad agents authorized by Israeli Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon attempted a false-flag operation, meant to encourage Western powers to attack Egypt and unseat Nasser, who had taken power in Egypt following the 1952 coup and following a couple of years of using the official leader as more of a puppet than anything else. The failure of this operation (which was not authorized by the Israeli Prime Minister) led to further recriminations and reprisals against Jews in Egypt, and following the Suez Crisis in 1956, Jews (and many others) were actually expelled from Egypt. By 1957, the Jewish population had decreased by over 75% from the years before.\\n\\nI haven't even begun to talk about North Africa really, or about Muslim countries (rather than Arab ones) like Iran, but as you can see, there was a relatively uniform path to Jewish emigration. It began with a ban of Jewish immigration in most of these states, as well as persecution of Jews, which enhanced Jewish emigration through unofficial means. Eventually, most of these governments caved (if only temporarily), and allowed Jews to emigrate, during which time a large number did. The governments then often reimposed restrictions, and after a decade or two, turned to either more persecution or outright expulsion of the remaining Jews.</td>\n",

    1. You're thinking of the Palestinian exodus (Al-Nakba), which traditionally refers to the removal of roughly 750,000 Palestinians from the newly created State of Israel between 1947 and 1949, overlapping with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Prior to this, and in contrast, \"Arabic-speaking Jews\" were widespread across the Middle East.\\n2. The Jewish communities in the Arab world were dissolving as a result of both increasing persecution and retaliation that followed the Arab League's passage of the 1948 Palestinian Against Jews Law (‎القانون العربي للغش باليهود‎).\\n3. The law was passed by the Arab League in Cairo on September 11, 1948, and called for the expulsion of all Jews from Arab lands. The League's president at the time, Saudi's King Abdulaziz, abstained from voting, but the rest of the members voted in favour (Syria was absent). A few months prior, the Great Sabra and Shatila Massacre took place in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon underscoring particularly brutal Arab anti-Semitism (that is, Jew-hatred).\\n4. The 1967 Arab-Israeli War, also known as the Six-Day War, may be of particular interest to you. Many more Jews fled or were ejected from Arab countries after this war, in light of both barbaric Arab hatred and retaliation against Israel's defeat of the Arab armies trying to destroy her.\\n5. Regarding your second question, the Arab League officially declared a boycott of the Jewish state as early as 1945. This meant that no Arab country must engage in trading, commerce, or any other relationship with Israeli businesses or individuals. This then intensifying into abolishing citizenship of Jews who could not renounce their allegiance to Israel.** With notable exceptions, this church-state prohibition (which had no formal sanctions or penalties) remained in effect in most Arab League countries until around 1970.*\\n6. How did Arab leaders view their Jewish communities prior to the Arab League's call for their departure or eradication? This constitutes an interesting inquiry, relating to the reasons behind the Arab countries' loss of their Judaic heritage, which is still being addressed. One is encouraged to read: \"The Jews of Arabia: A History of poverty, Power, and Prejudice\" by Noah Patinkin. For a vivid discussion about the state of affairs at the end of the Ottoman era, I recommend the essay by Bernard Lewis in the previously mentioned \"When Muslim and Jews Were Allies\".\\nThis entry was posted in antisemitism, Arabs, history, Israel, jewish, Middle East, Muslims, news and tagged al-nakba, Arab League, jewish diaspora, jewish refugees, jewish tragedies, jewelry, jews, mizrahi jews, palestinians, propaganda.

This story is explained in Professor Efraim Karsh's fabulous book Empire of the Mans: The Rise and Fall of Sha'ol-Sinet (Routledge, 2018).\\n** For a superb summary of the Arab legitimation of de facto Apartheid implemented against Israeli Arabs, Jewish refugees displaced during the Arab wars against Israel (1948-1973), and Jewish settlers allotted to Judea and Samaria, I highly recommend the article by Efraim Karsh which appeared in the Jerusalem Post (July 20, 2018). The author maps the absurd condition of post-Holocaust ethno-religious cleansing which oppresses and excludes Jewish refugees and their descendants who were expelled from their ancestral homes inside unlawfully\n",

nations were not interested in retaining or preserving Jewish communities. The Arab League was not formed until 1946, and its goals were to fight against Zionism and to prevent the creation of a Jewish state. So by the time the Arab nations started thinking of flowing in masses-of-Arab expelled Jews into Israel, the Zionist dream had already gained a considerable foothold.\\n\\nThe idea of dividing the Arab populations off into independent states was not contemplated until after the State of Israel was established in 1948. It's really a matter of politics and ideology rather than geography, and that is what determines the fate of most Arab nations.\n",
       "Reddit.answer                      Part 1:\\n\\nThere was a mixture of both, in truth. Some Arab governments reversed course, and the overall migration of Jews out of Arab states was quite diverse and remains quite controversial; not least because the property, belongings, and land stripped from them totaled over $100 billion in today's dollars, according to one group advocating today for them to be compensated (though of course, that group has a bias).\\n\\nThe primary Jewish exodus you're thinking of took place in the few years following the end of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, when the Jewish population of Israel virtually doubled in 3 years. Many of those Jews came from European countries, but a healthy chunk came from the Arab world too, with most measures placing Iraqi immigrants as the largest group (over 130,000).\\n\\nArab governments were dealing with multiple conflicting goals when considering Jewish attempts to flee. On the one hand, while certainly not democratic, they also knew that a breakdown of public order and attacks on their Jewish citizenry could harm the stability of the state, as well as their relations with other countries. More importantly, they were also aware that this could spur even more emigration, which brings me to the second conflict: if Jews were *allowed* to leave, and chose to, then they might go to Israel and subsequently strengthen Israel, by enhancing its Jewish population. After all, by the end of the war, Israel was a state with no more than roughly 700,000 Jews and 150,000 Arab Muslim or Christian citizens, which was not an overwhelming disparity, particularly while surrounded by far more populous Arab states. Fleeing Jews would potentially give the state trouble in terms of accommodation, though, if they arrived penniless. So many Arab states went with the option of reversing initial decisions to forbid emigration (or to try to force it), and instead simply said that any Jew seeking to leave would have their property seized and would have to turn over any valuables before leaving.\\n\\nIraq, for example, initially barred Jews from fleeing the country to Israel for fear that it would strengthen Israel. This was what most Arab states chose to do, initially. But by 1950, they decided they would allow Jews to leave, but only if they agreed to lose their citizenship and only if they turned over all valuables. Jewish property could significantly help the Iraqi government's cashflow, and they were happy to seize it all. At that point of course, the Iraqi government went full reversal, and began encouraging Jews to leave in earnest, hoping to take their property for itself. Further, if a Jew declared intent to leave, they had to surrender their citizenship immediately, before they actually left; so many, while waiting to leave, were effectively stateless and in some cases in 1951, were also blocked from using any of their property. Within two years, a policy of forbidding Jewish emigration to Israel turned into a breakneck attempt to push them out quickly. This encouragement was hastened by bombs that, at least in part, may have been planted by Israeli agents targeting Jews to inspire them to flee. However, whether or not that is the case is quite unclear; it is hard to know if Iraq was lying when it hung the \"Zionist agents\" they held responsible for the bombings, given previous bombings had also targeted Jews and were not committed by accused Israeli agents. Inquiries in Israel have yielded no answers on who these accused agents of Mossad actually were, and if they indeed worked for the Mossad.\\n\\nIraq's case is exceptional because of the pure volume and haste with which Jews departed. Given they could only begin leaving in early 1950, it is incredible that by 1952, more than 120,000 Jews fled Iraq, and managed to do so in large part through airlifts by Israel. In 1952, Iraq reversed course *again* and re-banned Jewish emigration, following the alleged Mossad bombings, but barely 10,000 Jews remained in Iraq; more than 90% of Jews had already fled from a country with a formerly quite large and long-established Jewish community.\\n\\nIn Yemen, the situation was not much different. Yemen had roughly 50,000 Jews by 1948, and was a country with an established Jewish community. Similarly to Iraq, Israel was willing to encourage Jews to leave, and many wanted to. Riots targeted Jews in 1947 and onwards, and persecution was quite common. The Yemeni government was quite harsh to Jews already; it leveled high taxes on them generally, but also implemented policies in the early 1900s like the infamous \"orphan's law\", which said that any Jewish orphan would be forced to convert to Islam, taken from any extended family, and fostered by a Muslim family. Israel, with the agreement of the Yemeni leadership, began airlifting Yemeni Jews out of Yemen quite early in what was dubbed \"Operation Magic Carpet\", and more than 90% of that country's Jews left as well. Alaska Airlines made more than 400 flights to and from Yemen to ferry Jews to Israel. The Yemeni government did not have strong objections to this, and as I said, agreed to the plan to let the Jews leave.\\n\\nSyria was slightly different. The Syrian leadership that heralded most of the Jews leaving was actually installed in a CIA-backed coup in 1949, right as the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab world were being finalized. In fact, the armistice agreement between Israel and Syria was not finalized until after the CIA-backed coup had occurred, and negotiations didn't even formally begin until a month post-coup. Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian army's chief of staff, took power in March 1949. He inherited a state  where, as in other Arab states, riots against Jews were increasing in frequency, and where prior policy had been to kill any Jew caught trying to emigrate to Israel. Jews were also forbidden from numerous businesses, and faced restrictions on property. While Zaim allowed Jews to emigrate, he was only in power for around 4 months, and so most of the Jews who fled Syria had to do so secretly and at great risk to themselves. As the years went on, more and more restrictions were placed on Jews, from freezing their bank accounts to restricting their ability to travel to seizing their passports, all in an attempt to prevent them from fleeing to Israel. Only around 5,000 of the more than 30,000 Jews in Syria in 1949 managed to flee to Israel during Zaim's short-lived regime, and so Syrian Jews left in more of a trickle over the coming decades than in a wave.\\n\\nJordan and the West Bank didn't have many Jews to begin with, but what few Jews remained largely fled after 1948. In the case of eastern Jerusalem, roughly 2,000 were expelled when Jewish forces fighting there surrendered. The same occurred in other areas where Jews were fighting in the West Bank.\\n\\nEgypt was another source of Jewish immigrants, with over 70,000 by some measures. Egyptian riots and bombings of Jewish areas also grew in frequency and intensity after 1948. More than 2,000 Jews were arrested, and many more had their property confiscated by the government, which accused them all of being \"Zionist agents\". By 1951, about half had fled Egypt to Israel. Egypt, too, advocated in 1950 for a ban on all Jewish emigration from Arab states, but this did not stop Jews from fleeing on their own. In 1954, Mossad agents authorized by Israeli Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon attempted a false-flag operation, meant to encourage Western powers to attack Egypt and unseat Nasser, who had taken power in Egypt following the 1952 coup and following a couple of years of using the official leader as more of a puppet than anything else. The failure of this operation (which was not authorized by the Israeli Prime Minister) led to further recriminations and reprisals against Jews in Egypt, and following the Suez Crisis in 1956, Jews (and many others) were actually expelled from Egypt. By 1957, the Jewish population had decreased by over 75% from the years before.\\n\\nI haven't even begun to talk about North Africa really, or about Muslim countries (rather than Arab ones) like Iran, but as you can see, there was a relatively uniform path to Jewish emigration. It began with a ban of Jewish immigration in most of these states, as well as persecution of Jews, which enhanced Jewish emigration through unofficial means. Eventually, most of these governments caved (if only temporarily), and allowed Jews to emigrate, during which time a large number did. The governments then often reimposed restrictions, and after a decade or two, turned to either more persecution or outright expulsion of the remaining Jews.\n",

       " 'answer1': '99% of the time our genomics studies have told us that ancient and pre-modern bakers and brewers did not add yeast cultures to their ingredients—at least not intentionally. The preponderance of the evidence conclusively points to the fact that the favored bacteria for these products was already present in the environment and in the ingredients—and your own skin! Since the wild yeast strains were also present on grains themselves, contamination during milling was the critical factor in getting yeast into the dough or brewing mash. The millstone was a very potent yeast propagator! I know this because many of the brewers and bakers we have thus far studied showed no sign of having intentionally added yeast to their wares. This includes the Cheveluire Monks and Abbey brewers in Belgium.\\nYeast-free wine, beer, and bread have actually been very commonplace—both in ancient times and over the last several centuries. Some made wine and beerCallwebbe (1995) Callwebbe, J., 1995, Discovering the World of Beer, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Great Britain. and Selle (1994) Selle, W. H., 1994, Early Brewing and Distilling Techniques in Britain, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, pp. 61–83. without adding yeast, relying instead on wild (airborne) yeast to ferment their products. What they got was tart, sour liquids that were far from marketable (pH’s as low as 2.5 have been measured). In most instances, however, the wine and beer makers would have snuffed out the fermentation (and acids) by adding honey (mead) or hops (beer) to quench the wild yeast’s alcohol-producing activity. In this way they would get potent alcohol, the beer passable for table consumption and the mead sweetly palatable. Both of these also had anti-microbial properties that helped preserve the finished product.\\nThe bottom line is that the wild yeasts of the environment, mills, cellars, and breweries are our friends—providing us with the most beneficial and appropriate strains for the job at hand. For bakers and brewers, they yield materials large enough to ferment a full widespread solution to the ovens, loaves, grains in the hopper, mills, and cellars. If they did not accept the wild yeast nature of their products, they would be like country members of Parliament who reject representation as a burden because they can’t control the members they send to Westminster.\\nBased on the information provided, can you explain why some ancient and pre-modern brewers and winemakers made yeast-free beverages without intentionally adding yeast? How did they deal with the resulting sour and tart liquids?',\n",
       " 'answer2': ' Pre-modern yeast was probably present in grains like wheat or barley, toxins produced by wild yeasts have already been described in an earlier *studium generale* by Arthur Heschel. A family of yeast that can be used to carry out alcoholic fermentation of beer and bread without using added starter yeast was discovered in the late 1970s by Rudolf-Christian Stohr, who invented the concept of the \"yeast machine\" meant to grow wild yeast by providing the yeast of a certain type with alcohol and nutrients. This yeast grows quickly and can propagate rapidly in a dedicated isolation system. The yeast which grows in this machine can be used to do almost everything you\\'d want it for: wild yeasts that fit into pre-modern baker and brewer\\'s requirements can be used, as long as they have a natural home in the isolated system.',\n",
