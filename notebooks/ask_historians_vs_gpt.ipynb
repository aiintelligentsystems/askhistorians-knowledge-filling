      "Q: What was the medical field like during the Islamic age? - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    During the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), the medical field witnessed significant advancements and contributions that impacted the course of medical knowledge throughout the world. Islamic civilization valued knowledge and scholarship, leading to the translation and preservation of Greek, Persian, and Indian medical texts. This cultural exchange fostered a rich and diverse medical tradition that built upon previous knowledge while adding new insights and discoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most notable advancements during this period was the establishment of hospitals, known as \"bimaristans\" or \"maristans.\" These institutions provided medical care to patients regardless of their social or economic status, marking an important development in the history of healthcare. Bimaristans were often associated with mosques or educational institutions, emphasizing the importance of spirituality and healing in Islamic society.\n",
      "\n",
      "An influential figure in Islamic medicine was Ibn Sina (Avicenna), whose monumental medical encyclopedia, \"The Canon of Medicine,\" became one of the most widely used medical texts in both Islamic and European civilizations for centuries. Avicenna's work systematically compiled medical knowledge from ancient Greek, Persian, and Arabic sources, covering a wide range of topics such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Islamic physicians made notable advances in the field of surgery as well. Al-Zahrawi (known as Albucasis in the Latin West) was a pioneering surgeon who wrote the influential book \"Kitab al-Tasrif\" (Book of Concessions). This comprehensive surgical treatise described various surgical procedures, instruments, and techniques, including those related to anesthesia, wound management, and orthopedics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pharmacy and pharmacology also thrived during the Islamic age. Islamic scholars developed a comprehensive understanding of medicinal plants and drugs, initiating the practice of pharmacy and the development of drug compounding techniques. Pharmacists (known as \"saydalani\" or \"at-tabieb al-A'tibb\") became an essential part of the healthcare system, preparing and dispensing medications based on the knowledge available at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Islamic civilization's reverence for knowledge and intellectual pursuits created an environment conducive to advances in the medical field. The translations and syntheses of medical works promoted by Islamic scholars during this era laid the foundation for further developments in medicine and significantly influenced medical practices in Europe in subsequent centuries. The contributions made during the Islamic Golden Age continue to be recognized as important milestones in medical history.\n",

      "Q: One thing i have taken notice is before mid Tang, asian people in the chinese cultural sphere aren't using any chair as furniture. Why? Do they start using chair as furniture because they assmilated cultures during their western expansion? - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "The absence of chairs as furniture in the early Chinese cultural sphere, specifically before the mid-Tang Dynasty, can be attributed to several factors. It is important to note that the use of chairs as furniture is not exclusive to Western cultures, as various civilizations across the globe utilized different seating arrangements throughout history.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the early Chinese dynasties, such as the Han and the early Tang, the predominant seating furniture was a mat or cushion placed on the floor, known as a \"kang\" or \"diban.\" This traditional seating arrangement had practical and cultural reasons behind its prevalence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pragmatically, the floor-based seating was better suited for the traditional style of eating and socializing in China. This custom, known as \"dining and sitting on the floor,\" involved people gathering around a low table to share meals, engage in conversation, and partake in various social activities. The absence of chairs allowed for a more interactive and communal atmosphere during these gatherings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Culturally, the use of floor-based seating aligns with the ancient Chinese philosophy of \"harmony with nature.\" The Chinese believed in maintaining a balance between man and his environment, and this was reflected in their furniture choices. Sitting close to the floor and directly engaging with nature's elements was seen as a way to cultivate a harmonious relationship with the surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth mentioning that the assimilation of cultures during China's western expansion, particularly through trade and interactions along the Silk Road, did introduce new ideas and practices, including foreign furniture designs. However, the adoption of chairs as furniture in China was a gradual process that occurred over centuries, even extending into the Song Dynasty and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incorporation of chair-based furniture was influenced by a mix of regional, cultural, and technological factors. Notably, the introduction of Buddhism played a role in promoting the use of chairs, as Buddhist monasteries imported seating furniture for religious ceremonies and meditation practices. Additionally, as Chinese society developed and its elite class sought to differentiate themselves, the adoption of more elaborate and comfortable seating options became a status symbol.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the absence of chairs as furniture in the Chinese cultural sphere before the mid-Tang Dynasty can be attributed to a combination of practical and cultural reasons. The transition to chair-based seating was not solely due to assimilation of Western cultures during China's expansion but rather a complex blend of indigenous customs, regional influences, and evolving societal preferences over an extended period of time.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): Hi, sorry for taking some time on this, I've been busy irl and with other posts here.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're right, chairs don't appear to be very common in China before this period.  However, they were probably introduced earlier, in the Six Dynasties period, or as native developments from the Han dynasty.  In \"The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture\", John Kieschnik gives a couple of possible origin points for the chair in China:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is an indigenous origin: various low tables, armrests, raised platforms, and so on were common in aristocratic households in the late Han.  Some of the raised platforms were quite similar to chairs in their use: they were sized for single people, and could be stored when not in use.  It's possible these independently evolved into chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second is from a 胡床 *huchuang* (literally something like barbarian seat), a type of [folding chair or stool]([LINK]  As the name suggests, they came from outside of China: originating in Egypt and spreading across Central Asia and into China during the Han dynasty, where the court, apparently enjoying various exotic foreign things started using them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is the \"Nestorian Hypothesis\", where a handful of Nestorian Christian craftsmen introduced the technological techniques sometime in the seventh century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there's the hypothesis that chairs were introduced through Buddhism in the Six Dynasties period, and by the mid Tang started to spread from there throughout Chinese society.  Chairs were quite common in Buddhist temples in India, and were used in India as early as 200 BC.  This hypothesis holds that chairs were introduced ultimately from India, through Central Asia, to China during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He considers the last hypothesis to be the most likely origin point.  That Chinese craftsmen were making various chair like objects, from huchuang to movable raised platforms, and so on, suggests they already had the technology to make chairs well before the Nestorian hypothesis has the technology being introduced.  Various Chinese writers, writing from the Song and Ming dynasties, made similar observations that the by then very common chair wasn't present in Han and pre-Han periouds, and when trying to trace it's origin argued that the huchuang, while maybe leading to other types of folding chairs, apparently had no direct connection with fixed chairs, nor did the other Han dynasty chair like objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the earliest depictions of true chairs all seem to be in Buddhist contexts: certain Buddhas, such as the Maitreya, were commonly show in Chinese art from the 400s on sitting in chairs, and corded-chairs appear in translation of Buddhist works at this time.  The earliest depictions of chairs in Chinese contexts also come from around the fall of the Northern Wei, starting on a stele around 535.  This and the next representations we have over the ensuing decades are all in Buddhist contexts, with monks sitting and meditating on corded-chairs, just as in India.  Even in the early Tang, textual evidence also strongly associates chairs with Buddhism.  This includes a monk, Yijing, complaining that monks don't sit in chairs properly when compared with proper Indian monks, and noting that chairs were probably introduced into monasteries around the third century, as well as various documents talking about officials visiting monasteries and being seated in chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, how this spread to society as a whole is unclear.  Kieschnik thinks the court may have played some role in popularizing them, but thinks in a highly religious time, lay people visiting temples would have naturally wanted to copy the environment there.  Ironically, after they spread the original Buddhist associations were kind of forgotten, and the connection between chairs and religion lost to the point where people were complaining about chairs being a symbol of spiritually decayed and corrupted lay life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Kieschnik makes a strong case that this is where they came from, and that the Nestorian hypothesis is almost certainly wrong.  There is still a chance that the other two hypothesis are correct, though less likely, but the timeline looks somewhat similar with much earlier origins, then spreading during the Tang dynasty.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: The tradition of men having short hair and women having long hair can be traced back to various ancient civilizations and cultural norms that have evolved over time. However, it is important to note that these traditions were not universal, and there have been instances where the norms were reversed in certain cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ancient times, among the Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, it was generally expected for men to have shorter hair while women wore their hair long. Social status and occupation also played a role in determining the length of one's hair. For instance, in ancient Rome, senators and patricians were often depicted with short-cropped hair, while long hair was associated with slaves and lower classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the medieval period in Europe, the tradition of men having shorter hair continued, partly due to practical reasons such as combat and helmet use. Additionally, religious beliefs and societal norms influenced hair length, with church authorities often advocating for shorter hair for both men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth mentioning that while these traditions were prevalent in many cultures, there were exceptions. For example, among certain Native American tribes, men traditionally had long hair while women's hair was cut short. These cultural practices varied greatly across tribes and were often associated with specific rituals and roles within the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the association of short hair with men and long hair with women is deeply ingrained in many cultures worldwide, largely due to historical practices and societal expectations. However, it is essential to recognize that cultural practices surrounding hairstyles have been fluid throughout history, and there have always been exceptions and variations to these widely observed norms.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1935, Persia officially changed its name to Iran. This decision was primarily made to promote cultural and historical unity among the diverse ethnic groups within the country, as well as to assert the Persian identity that has resonated throughout its long history. \n",
      "\n",
      "The name \"Iran\" derives from the term \"Aryan,\" which is mentioned in ancient Iranian texts and denotes its connection to the Indo-European language family. During the early 20th century, as countries across the globe were embracing their unique cultural identities, many Persians felt that the name \"Persia\" solely reflected the dominant ethnic group and neglected the contributions of other minorities present in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran at that time, believed that renaming the country \"Iran\" would emphasize the shared heritage and history of all the Iranian people, thus promoting a sense of national unity. This change also came as part of a broader modernization campaign that aimed to reshape Iran as a progressive, industrial nation. By adopting the name \"Iran,\" the country sought to shed the image of being solely associated with its ancient past and instead embrace a more contemporary identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The official name change to Iran was announced internationally in 1935 and gradually, over time, the usage of the name \"Persia\" diminished. However, it is worth noting that while Persia and Iran are often used interchangeably, Persia technically refers to a specific historical region within present-day Iran, encompassing areas such as Fars, where the Persian Empire originated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the decision to change the name from Persia to Iran was a conscious effort to reflect the diversity within the country and reaffirm a national identity that encompasses all ethnic groups, while also embracing a more modern and forward-looking perspective.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): Internally they never did. Within Persia the name has pretty much always been a variant of Iran. At least as early as the Sassanids, they called it Iran or Iranshahr. I'm not sure what the Achaemenids called it, if they did at all, but since them it's been Iran. Exact spellings and pronunciations varied over the millennia, but it's consistently remained Iran or a close variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persia is the Greek name for the Achaemenid empire. Probably named after Cyrus the Great's tribe, the Pars. Once coined the name remained the name for the people and region in Greek, and afterwards within the Roman Republic and Empire. When the Empire faded, its successor states continued to use the Persian name. \n",
      "\n",

But I've found reading historical texts or books about historical subjects difficult, because I feel like I have a lack of skills or knowledge when reading these kinds of books. I am able to understand a lot of what I read, but I need a structured way to look at these texts to improve my research of historical topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do historians keep a certain framework in mind when studying historical texts or books? For example, politics, economy, culture, geography etc.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: As a historian, I understand your concern about effectively researching historical texts and books. It is common to feel overwhelmed when starting out, but with a structured approach, you can enhance your understanding of historical subjects and extract valuable information from the texts you read.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, historians generally approach their research with a systematic framework that takes into account various aspects of historical analysis. While the specific framework may vary depending on the research question or topic at hand, there are indeed key areas to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Contextualize the topic: Begin by placing the historical text within its broader context. Consider the time period, geographical location, and major events that surround the subject matter. This will help you understand the background and motivations of the authors, as well as grasp the relevance of the information presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Identify the main arguments: Pay attention to the central arguments or claims made by the author. Look for the main thesis or purpose of the text. This will allow you to assess the author's perspective and approach to the topic, which is crucial for critically evaluating the information presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Analyze sources and evidence: Scrutinize the sources and evidence used by the author to support their arguments. Assess the reliability, credibility, and biases of these sources. Look for primary sources (documents, diaries, letters) and secondary sources (books, articles) cited within the text. Evaluating the evidence used is vital in forming your own interpretation and determining the strength of the arguments presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider multiple perspectives: Historians often explore different interpretations and viewpoints of a particular historical event or period. Engage with other historians' opinions and compare different sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. By doing so, you will develop a well-rounded analysis and be able to form your own informed opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Examine interdisciplinary aspects: History is a multidisciplinary field that integrates various elements such as politics, economy, culture, geography, and social structures. Pay attention to how these factors are addressed within the text and consider their influence on the historical narrative. This holistic approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Take notes and create a research journal: While reading historical texts, maintain a research journal to record your thoughts, insights, and key findings. Summarize each text, highlight important points, and make note of any references or sources that catch your attention. This will help organize your thoughts and facilitate further research and cross-referencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, becoming proficient in historical research is a gradual process. Practice and exposure to a wide range of historical texts and sources will gradually deepen your understanding and improve your research skills. Additionally, exploring academic journals, attending lectures or seminars, and engaging in discussions with fellow history enthusiasts can also enhance your knowledge and provide new perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following this structured framework, you will be able to approach historical texts and books with more confidence and effectively conduct research on historical topics. Happy exploring!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): I'm guessing that as a couch historian you're often reading very generalized works that cover a lot of subjects and discuss them in very broad terms: basically popular history. Most history books for the general public are written like that because it makes them more accessible, they don't require knowledge up front, or only very little. These types of books often do not have in-text references as to where they get their information from. This makes them a bad source if you're trying to get a clear understanding of a certain subject. If you want to understand something, you need to understand the source material.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But like I said, they are great at providing basic, broad, general information about a large variety of subjects. Even if you feel the subject is quite small, let's say the life of only 1 specific person, these general books can never provide all the details about their lives that are discussed in academic literature. These books function much like wikipedia, and provide an introduction into all kinds of subjects, often generalizing and simplifying discussions: they are actually providing a nice framework to work from. From there you can actually start researching yourself. Whenever you find a subject that intrigues you, or don't quite understand, leave the broad history books behind and try to find specialized literature about it, be it online or in the library. Articles in magazines are often a great place to start looking for very specific information. You can then use the specialized knowledge you've gained and fit it neatly into the larger framework of basic historical outlines that you already have.

It helps you focus on what information is important and what information isn't.

      "Q: Before the invention of accurate equipment and scales for measuring temperature, how did people discuss or conceptualised temperature? - TL;DR: Before we had temperature scales like Celsius' or Fahrenheit's, did people understood temperature as gradient, or as a group of landmarks, e.g. \"body temperature\" vs. \"boiling water\", or as something completely different?\n",
      "\n",
      "In early philosophy we find a discussion on nature of things, and the idea that things have qualities (eternal or ethereal), or that there are \"forms\" that define how such qualities come about. One example the form of being \"warm\" or \"cold\", for example, or objects having the quality of warmness or coldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This point of view seems to me a bit binary, that is, something is either warm, or not (or if you follow the Indian skeptic Nagarjuna, either warm, not warm, both warm and not warm and neither warm nor not warm). But there are obvious easy to perceive examples of different levels of warmness or coldness. For example, there is warm to the touch, and there is too-warm-too touch; there is hot water, boiling water, heat that melts gold or lead, and heat that can bend iron; a cold stream, a frozen lake, or a real terrible cold that your best coat cannot ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists like Fahrenheit and Celsius have established both means for measuring temperature and a scale, strengthening the  notion that temperature is a gradient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the modern idea of temperature, how it was perceived? For example, did people recognised the difference between 0°C (when water freeze) and -27°C (when hard liqueur freezes)?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Before the development of accurate equipment and standardized temperature scales like Celsius or Fahrenheit, people conceptualized temperature in various ways depending on their observations and experiences. While there was not a precise understanding of temperature gradients as we have today, individuals still recognized differences in warmth and coldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ancient times, philosophical discussions on the nature of things often involved the concept of qualities or forms, which were believed to define the characteristics of objects. One such quality was \"warmness\" or \"coldness,\" which was seen as inherent to certain objects or substances. This understanding of temperature was relatively binary, with something being either warm or not warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, people also recognized that there were varying levels of warmth and coldness. They observed differences in objects' ability to transfer heat, such as feeling warm to the touch or being too hot to handle. Furthermore, they observed different phenomena associated with temperature, such as boiling water, melting gold or lead, or the ability of extreme cold to freeze bodies of water or make it difficult to endure without proper protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they lacked precise temperature scales, people had a practical understanding of temperature distinctions based on these observable differences. For example, they recognized that there was a significant distinction between water freezing at 0°C and hard liquor freezing at -27°C, even without having a specific numerical value for each temperature point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the ancient understanding of temperature lacked the scientific precision of modern measurement and scales, people still perceived and recognized temperature differences based on their sensory experiences and observations of various natural phenomena.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): What you are really asking about is the science of thermometry, which is to say, the measurement of temperature itself. It is interesting to note that at least in the West, trying to \"measure temperature\" at all did not really occur until the 17th century. This is despite the fact that there were many contexts in which temperature mattered before then: cooking, alchemy, metallurgy, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "However I suspect that cooking is the most revealing and useful of these pre-thermometric approaches because most cooks today are non-thermometric to a large degree: unless you are using a tool by which you can very specifically set the temperature (like a modern oven), one tends to make things either hot or not, and use ones well-honed-over-time sense of heat to know when something is in the acceptable range. When I cook an egg, I set the burner to \"in between maximum and off,\" and then I hover my hand above the pan to know when it is the right temperature. I don't even know, in a precise sense, what the right temperature _is_, thermometrically, but I know it when I feel it, because I have been cooking eggs for decades now (and am fairly good at it, unlike pretty much anything else I cook), and so have developed what is known as a _tacit knowledge_ (embodied experience) that lets me easily judge what I need it to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can imagine that prior to thermometry, one would see similar sorts of things elsewhere. For example, in metallurgy, one can define the type of oven one needs to achieve a specific result (say, the melting of iron), without knowing what the actual melting point is. Instructions can be similar operationalized: \"wash the lead with quicksilver, then melt it,\" is an alchemical instruction that does not require thermometry, because it assumes that the desired end state (\"melt it\") is instructive-enough. (And someone who became proficient at alchemy would spend many, many years learning how to make such instructions real, just as an experienced cook knows what \"beat until light and frothy\" means, even if there is not a precise technical definition of \"light and frothy.\") And to your specific point, any alchemist worth their salt of tartar would know that different substances melted, boiled, and froze at different amounts of heat and cold — but they would not have some specific measurement to record for that, other than the fact of it (which is a measurement of its own, in a way: \"heat until boiled,\" is just as precise an instruction as \"heat until 212ºF\"). Again, cooking is instructive: how many of us actually know the melting point of butter, precisely? (It's 90ºF, apparently, but I had to look it up.) It is not that important for the purpose of cooking to know this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this changes the perspective on the question quite a bit — why invent thermometry at all? That in Europe this happened in the 17th century is not very surprising, because this is when the study of the natural world took a more quantitative and observational turn, as part of what we sometimes call the Scientific Revolution. It was in this time that all sorts of new instruments and scales and metrics were developed for giving precision to observations across the gamut of natural experience, because the power of doing so was becoming evident. \n",
      "\n",
      "It should be emphasized that thermometry involved quite a lot of work. It wasn't just Celsius and Fahrenheit showing up and saying, \"here's how to do it.\" There were alternative approaches and stark disagreement on both what one was measuring (what _is_ heat, anyway?) and how to measure it (should you use air, water, mercury, something else?). \n",
      "\n",
      "The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales both rely on the so-called \"two-point\" system (pick two easily-measurable state changes — like boiling and freezing of water under constant pressure — and assume that temperature is a linear gradient between them), which itself was conceptually assailable (anyone who has tried to experiment with the knobs of a shower know that temperature doesn't _feel_ like a linear gradient!), and also makes assumptions about how you measure it (does your measuring fluid expand linearly with linear changes in temperature? how would you know if it didn't?). \n",
      "\n",
      "It is remarkable that thermometry got pretty much a lot of it \"right,\" in the long run, given that the theories of heat that motivated much of the work (like phlogiston) were totally wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, there is a lot more that could be said about the history of thermometry, and it presents quite a lot of interesting philosophical/historical questions about how to measure phenomena that one does not truly understand at a deep level. The definitive author on this topic is Hasok Chang (_Inventing Temperature: Measurement and Scientific Progress_, Oxford University Press, 2004), whose work, coincidentally enough, is what initially got me interested in the history of science.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: Yes, in addition to the famous Polish lancer cavalry of the Guard, Napoleon did have other Polish light cavalry regiments in his army. The Polish cavalry had a long-standing reputation for their exceptional horsemanship and battle prowess, which is why Napoleon utilized their services extensively throughout his military campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the Polish lancer cavalry of the Guard, which was directly attached to Napoleon's elite Imperial Guard, there were several other Polish light cavalry regiments that served under his command. One notable regiment was the Polish Vistula Legion, formed in Italy in 1808. Initially composed of Polish volunteers, this regiment eventually expanded and became a highly regarded unit within the French cavalry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another prominent Polish cavalry unit was the Polish Regiment of Light Horse-Lancers, also known as the \"Lighthorse Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard.\" This regiment was part of the larger Guard cavalry and served alongside the Polish lancer cavalry of the Guard. They were distinguished by their distinctive blue and red uniforms, adorned with rich decorations and plumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, several other Polish regiments served as light cavalry in Napoleon's army, such as the Polish Uhlans and Hussars. These regiments played crucial roles in various battles, showcasing their exceptional skill in both reconnaissance and shock tactics.\n",

      "Overall, Napoleon saw the value of incorporating Polish cavalry into his forces due to their expertise and combat effectiveness. This led to the establishment and utilization of multiple Polish light cavalry regiments alongside the renowned Polish lancer cavalry of the Guard.\n",

      "A (reddit): For future reference, this question is a good candidate for the Short Answers to Simple Questions thread.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That aside, the Polish lancers in the guard were not the only Polish light horse in Napoleon's army.  Especially in his latter campaigns in Russia and Germany, Napoleon relied heavily on Polish contingents, alongside Germans and Italians, to match the armies of the enemy coalitions in the face of constant losses.  The Duchy of Warsaw was a satellite state of France, carved out of the Polish territories of Prussia and Austria, and as such it was obligated to furnish troops for Napoleon's campaigns.  During the invasion of Russia, these troops numbered more than 100,000, and were indeed the first casualties in the campaign, with several drowning during the crossing of the Nieman river.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Most Polish troops served in 5th Corps under Poniatowski, but most of the lancers fought as part of 4th Cavalry Corps in the uhlan regiments; the light cavalry division of Poniatowski's corps was mostly chasseurs.  In the 1813 campaign in Germany, the army was reorganized, with the Poles forming the bulk of 7th Corps; they had a small advance guard, consisting of a cuirassier regiment and the *krakus* light horse, mounted on very small ponies and armed with lances.

      "Q: Why do schools teach fake or incomplete versions of history to students in the first place? - From lighter things like Washington chopping down a cherry tree, to more significant things like Columbus landing in America and being nice to natives, that everyone believed the world was flat, that Rosa Parks was the first African American to not move from her bus and she just did it because her feet hurt. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are many of these fake histories that are taught, only to be retaught later with the more accurate version (sometimes not at all).  Why teach the wrong version in the first place?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: As a historian, I understand the concern regarding the teaching of incomplete or inaccurate versions of history in schools. However, it is important to approach this issue understanding the factors that contribute to the dissemination of such \"fake histories\" within educational settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key reason for the inclusion of simplified or embellished versions of historical events is the need to introduce complex concepts and narratives to young students in a way that is accessible and engaging. Historical events and figures are often presented in a simplified manner to make them more relatable and memorable to young minds. Consider, for example, the story of George Washington chopping down a cherry tree. Though this particular anecdote may be fictional, it is used as a tool to teach young children about the values of honesty and integrity associated with the founding fathers of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, historical inaccuracies can also result from the biases and limitations of educational materials and resources available. Textbooks and teaching materials are often based on interpretations of history that may be influenced by prevailing political, social, or cultural perspectives. Biases can emerge due to the limitations of available evidence, the influence of certain narratives, or the omission of marginalized voices in historical accounts. Thus, the dissemination of incomplete or inaccurate versions of history can perpetuate an unintentional transmission of biased information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, historical knowledge is not static; it evolves and adapts as new research, discoveries, and interpretations emerge over time. This means that there will always be an ongoing process of revisiting and reevaluating historical narratives. As our understanding of history expands, previously incomplete or misguided representations are often replaced with more accurate versions. However, the pace at which these updates are incorporated into educational curricula can vary, resulting in students being exposed to outdated information.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the teaching of incomplete or inaccurate versions of history can be a concern, it is crucial to recognize that various factors contribute to its occurrence. These factors range from the need to simplify complex narratives for young students to the inherent biases in historical accounts. Acknowledging these complexities allows us to work towards an education system that encourages critical thinking, promotes a deeper understanding of historical contexts, and fosters an ongoing appreciation for the ever-evolving nature of historical knowledge.\n",

      "A (reddit): Until the mid-1800's or so, the purpose of formal education in these United States was mostly about providing the sons of those with access to power (which is to say white men) the knowledge base common among those with access to power. The curriculum, known as Classical, focused on Greek, Latin, logic, rhetoric, some math, and some sciences. They learned Latin, not because it was useful, but because smart men knew Greek, Latin, etc. Studying history, English literature, and modern languages like French and Spanish were seen as less necessary and usually not a part of formal education. This isn't to say the boys wouldn't learn about history or read literature, rather that, in the hierarchy of what teachers and tutors were responsible for teaching, they were low priority. In effect, history was taught with broad strokes, focusing on Great Men and the things they did. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, their sisters received an education that aligned to the notion of \"Republican Motherhood.\" She learned logic and rhetoric, not because it was important for her future, but for the sons she would inevitably raise up to be good citizens. This, especially in the Northern states, resulted in a system where the children of wealthy men rarely came in contact with the sons of merchants, farmers, and tradesmen. (White and Black children were deliberately and explicitly kept apart. In most Southern states, enslaved people who attended school or were caught with reading materials were beaten or whipped. Free Black children typically attended segregated schools.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A sea change began in the 1840's. The idea that America would be better off by ensuring all future voters - i.e. white boys - had a shared educational experience began to catch on. In other words, those in power began to see it as a bad thing that poor men and rich men's sons rarely interacted or had a common knowledge base. Wealthy men in towns and cities embraced the idea of school taxes and polls, seeing funded education as a public good. As such, schoolhouses popped up across the country at a steady pace. In order to staff them, public education advocates pushed for the transformation of the teaching profession.  The notion of Republican Motherhood expanded and shifted to fall on the schoolteacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas for generations, school had been a place where mostly male tutors taught the sons of men with access to means and power meaningless knowledge, by the end of the Civil War school had become a place where mostly young, unmarried women taught the sons and daughters of anyone who showed up useful meaningful knowledge. Granted, they weren't teaching function skills like how to farm or how to make things (industrial education wouldn't come along until the next century), but beyond useful skills like writing, reading, and arithmetic, meaningful knowledge included learning what it meant to be an American. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first half of the 19th century, the content students were taught around what  it meant to be American was virtually indistinguishable from what it meant to be a good Protestant. Religious phrases and stories were featured heavily in early primers and readers and many of the rituals of school resembled that of Protestant church services. (One of the reasons mixed gender education was never really an issue in the United States was because during Protestant services, families sit together. There is no separation of the genders for services. Some education historians seen connections between how children are taught to walk in single file lines with their hands to themselves as similar to how people move through church to receive the Eucharist.) However, after the Civil War, many of the Protestant stories and texts were replaced by Americana, big stories about big men who were a part of creating this big great country. Teachers typically only had children for a few months for a few years, and these stories were weave into songs, texts, pubic performances, and routine writing practice. \n",
      "\n",
      "While all of this was happening, politicians and businessmen were trying to figure out how to deal with the problem that nearly every person working in an essential-for-American-cohesion job was a woman. To complicate matters, education is a matter left up to the states - which means every state developed its own system of education and teacher training. Through a number of events and social norms, the teacher profession became entrenched in culture as something for women, mostly white. Teachers began holding national conferences and collaborate around curriculum. They developed new courses and topics, focusing on the more modern, liberal arts subjects. This new curriculum, known as Modern or English, was taught by young, mostly white women and history instruction continued to present big stories and Big Men. \n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually all of what you listed is, in one way or another, linked to race, which in the United States, is about chattel slavery. (Except the \"world being flat\", which is about how science is taught - which is its own long answer.) Historically, talking about and dealing with issues related to race isn't something most white women are good at. Teaching is described at a career with a 13-year-old apprenticeship - going 13 years without seeing a white teacher talk about race, about the fuller story around American history, leaves the impression that talking about race is something that shouldn't be done. So, it means teachers struggle to find the words to teach children about the man who wrote our Declaration of Independence while being served by an enslaved person that he owned as property. As a result, elementary level history tends to fall back into larger than life versions of people and events that white women are comfortable with. Telling the full story around Ms. Parks means talking about the entire system set up around the boycotts and the careful planning that went into the movement. And that's hard to talk about - it's hard to talk about how the husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons of white teachers were the ones making Ms. Rosa move her seat, or the ones firebombing King's house, or killing members of the Freedom Rides. So, until recently, teachers set aside that hard history.\n",
      "\n",
      "You asked about the history being taught again the right way and that often happens when students get to high school. In many schools, students are explicit taught how to see through the elementary version of Big Men in History. However, it's worth noting elementary level has begun to evolved in the modern era as those in power are listening to more and different voices. There have always been teachers of color, feminist teachers, activist teachers, teachers with disabilities pushing for de-centering those with power and centering those denied it. As long as there's been teachers pushing the enslaved people owned by Jefferson back, there's been teachers working to pull them forward. So, it's less that all teachers do it, but rather, the culture of American schools is such that it's more comfortable to tell an easier version than a truer version.\n",

      "Q: Why was the USS Constitution(Old Ironsides) so successful during its service? - I was wondering why Old Ironsides was victorious in so many of its engagements. Was it the commanding officers, or maybe was it built differently than other ships of the era?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Response: The success of the USS Constitution, affectionately known as Old Ironsides, during its service can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, the ship was constructed to be remarkably sturdy and well-protected, with thick oak planking and a unique design that offered enhanced structural integrity. This design, coupled with the ship's strategic use of diagonal cross-bracing, greatly increased its resilience to enemy fire, earning it the nickname \"Old Ironsides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the commanding officers of the USS Constitution played a crucial role in its success. These officers were highly skilled and experienced, possessing a deep understanding of naval tactics and combat strategies. They consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership qualities, effectively utilizing the ship's strengths and coordinating precise maneuvers during engagements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another significant factor behind the ship's triumphs was the proficiency and dedication of its crew. The sailors onboard the USS Constitution were rigorously trained and disciplined, working together seamlessly to efficiently carry out orders during battles. The crew's ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances, their excellent gunnery skills, and effective coordination contributed to the ship's victories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Old Ironsides benefited from its superior armament. The USS Constitution was armed with powerful long-range carronades, which provided a significant advantage in combat. These cannons unleashed devastating broadsides, capable of inflicting severe damage upon enemy vessels while keeping the Constitution relatively safe from harm due to its sturdy construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the USS Constitution's successes could also be partially attributed to a degree of luck. The ship managed to escape several potentially catastrophic situations, such as when enemy cannonballs remarkably bounced off its hull during the War of 1812, leading to widespread admiration and the birth of the \"Old Ironsides\" moniker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the USS Constitution's triumphs were a result of a combination of factors, including its robust construction, talented commanding officers, well-trained crew, superior armament, and fortuitous events.

Full disclosure, I know more about the Royal Navy and most of the references I make \n",
      "\n",
      "* The *Constitution* was what's known as a heavy frigate.  At 44 guns (oftentimes 50+), crewed by ~450 and just over 300 feet long with a top speed of 13-14 knots (almost 16mph), she was in a pretty exclusive bracket of ships:  fast and strong enough to chase down and deal with virtually any merchantman or lesser ship of war (small frigates, sloops, brigs, etc), tough enough to stand toe-to-toe with any comparable ship with good odds of surviving, and fast enough to get away from groups of ships or a big heavy 3rd or 2nd rate ship-of-the line. \n",

      "*  The *Constitution*'s design was a smart one for the time.  Proportionally the ship was very long and narrow for a frigate, and was built to mount lots of heavy guns.  It was engineered from the ground up to be a world-beater, not adapted from a captured ship or a straight copy of a foreign design. The shipwright (Humphreys) had a good relationship with the dockyard where she was built in Boston, and lots of skilled labor was available at the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Copper sheathing on the hull helped to reduce barnacles and shipworm, which extended hull life and made the ship faster than an un-sheathed hull.  This was a very expensive practice at the time, and not all ships had it. \n",

      "* The Naval Act of 1794 had authorized the construction of six big frigates to help combat the piracy of American ships around the globe. While a part of the British Empire, the Royal Navy protected American merchantmen. At the time, the US was still a brand-new country, and many countries didn't really take the US seriously.  The Barbary Coast was a place lots of American ships traded, and pirates were having a field day with US-owned ships at the time.  These six frigates were meant to patrol waters plied by American merchantmen, deterring piracy and acting as a show of force. As such, these frigates **needed* to be good ships.  Instead of authorizing a vast quantity of ships, Congress opted for quality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* I don't want to denigrate accomplishments, skill, or bravery of anybody involved but the *Constitution*'s victories were mostly against ships that she outgunned. When one ship outguns another, almost invariably it's a larger ship with more men and can take more of a beating to boot.  While the complement of guns varied over the years (from 44 to as many as 55), we'll stick with a nice round number of 50 for comparison:\n",
      "\n",
      "                   * During the Quasi War and Barbary Wars, *Constitution* took a lot of merchant prizes and beat up on a             bunch of crappy pirate vessels of varying quality. \n",

      "                   * Post War of 1812, the *Constitution* never fired another shot in anger, serving with varying Mediterranean squadrons for several decades.  Several prizes were taken without so much as a shot being fired. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Another thing to consider was the monstrous -weight- of the *Constitution*'s guns.  The bulk of it's armament consisted of 24 lb. long cannons and 32 lbs. carronades.  That's some seriously heavy weight for a frigate, when most of the time were armed with a mixture consisting mostly of 18 lb. and 12 lb. long guns, with a few heavy carronades and maybe some 24 lb. guns thrown into the mix.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* The *Constitution* did indeed have a pretty thick hull for the time, something like 21 inches of oak and pine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* The quality of crews was usually pretty good. While the US didn't have the naval tradition or training regimen of the Royal Navy set in place right at the beginning, they got better with time and experience.  The key to good crews of the time were good food (most sailors at better and more consistently at sea than they did in their own homes), discipline, and lots of training and structure.  IMO, the Royal Navy had better training, crew-retention, and harsher discipline, but it's hard to quantify crew quality in an objective figure.  \n",

      "A (gpt):    Answer: The relationship between Spain and Portugal during the 15th to 19th centuries is indeed a fascinating aspect of European history. While it is true that both countries shared common religious and imperial ambitions, Portugal managed to maintain its independence against Spain due to a multitude of factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Geographical Barriers: Firstly, Portugal's geography played a significant role in safeguarding its independence. Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on one side and having a rugged terrain on the other, Portugal had natural defensive advantages that hindered Spanish attempts to annex the country easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Treaty of Tordesillas: The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, played a vital role in delineating spheres of influence between Spain and Portugal. Under this agreement, the Pope drew an imaginary line dividing the newly discovered territories in the Americas and Africa between the two nations. This ensured that Portugal had a significant overseas empire of its own, relieving pressure from Spanish ambitions toward Portugal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Portuguese Naval Supremacy: During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal possessed an impressive naval fleet and was a pioneer in oceanic exploration. The Portuguese navigators skillfully established sea routes to India, Africa, and the Americas, creating a lucrative trade network. This naval prowess allowed Portugal to exert its influence and safeguard its interests against Spanish aggression.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Dynastic Union: A period of personal union known as the Iberian Union occurred from 1580 to 1640 when the crowns of Portugal and Spain were joined under the rule of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. While this union led to a consolidation of resources and power for Spain, Portugal's distinct identity and desire for independence persisted among its people. The Portuguese eventually revolted against Spanish rule, leading to the restoration of their independence in the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. European Power Dynamics: Throughout the period in question, various European powers had a vested interest in preventing a strong Spain from dominating the continent. This included rival nations such as England, France, and the Dutch Republic, who often allied themselves with Portugal to balance the power dynamics in Europe and contain Spanish influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Portugal successfully safeguarded its autonomy and resisted Spanish annexation due to its geographical advantages, the Treaty of Tordesillas, naval strength, a distinct cultural identity preserved through the Iberian Union, and the intervention of other European powers. These factors combined to ensure Portugal's survival as a separate nation, allowing it to maintain its overseas empire and contribute to the rich history of Europe.\n",

      "Q: Who was the first King of England to call himself English and not Norman? - After William usurped the Kingdom of England, he was still himself a Norman king. My question is, after William The Conqueror died and William II was inherited, was the culture swap from Norman to English immediate or did it take a few more generations until a King of England could be called \"English?\"\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: The shift from Norman to English culture and identity in England did not occur immediately after the reign of William the Conqueror. While William II, also known as William Rufus, inherited the throne from his father, he maintained his Norman heritage and did not explicitly identify as English. It is important to note that the process of cultural assimilation and the transition from Norman to English rule spanned several generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during the reign of William II's younger brother, King Henry I, that a stronger English identity began to emerge. King Henry I actively embraced English traditions, such as marrying an English queen, Matilda of Scotland, and issuing charters and laws written in both Norman French and English, indicating a growing acknowledgment of the English language and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it wasn't until the reign of King Stephen, who succeeded Henry I, that an English king explicitly referred to himself as an English monarch. King Stephen took the title of \"King of England\" rather than \"King of the English,\" distinguishing himself from previous Norman rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is essential to understand that the complete assimilation of Norman and English cultures and the establishment of a distinctly English identity took many more generations. It was during the reigns of subsequent monarchs, particularly Henry II, that England experienced a more significant cultural shift towards an English national identity.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): Not to nitpick the question or anything, but the first person to take the title \"King of the English\" was Æthelstan, who was crowned in 927. There are arguments over who exactly was the \"actual\" first king of all England, dating back to Alfred the Great, but Alfred and his son Edward the Elder (Æthelstan's father) never ruled the entire country. Æthelstan's successors, including his brother Edmund I and a succession of rulers descended from Edward the Elder and Edmund I, controlled England until the reign of Æþelræd Unræd(1) when Sweyn Forkbeard briefly ruled, and again once Æþelræd regained the throne. Æþelræd's son Edmund Ironside briefly ruled the kingdom until his defeat by Cnut of Denmark, when he was reduced to Wessex, which Cnut took over upon Edmund's death. Cnut's successors ruled England until 1042, when there was a brief \"Saxon restoration\" led by Æþelræd's son Edward the Confessor and his successor Harold Godwinson; Harold of course was killed at Hastings. \n",

Or why are all the greats in pretty much any field white? - It seems as though whether it's music, painting, sculpting, science, philosophy, architecture or *anything*, pretty much all of the really famous guys (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Newton, Plato, Aristotle) are all white Europeans. Where are all the famous Asians and Africans? Do students educated in different parts of the world have their own \"Beethovens\" and \"Da Vinci's\" that I don't know about? \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Thank you for your question! It is important to address the perception that the great figures in various fields are predominantly white Europeans. The reason behind this perception is multi-faceted and requires a nuanced understanding of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, when we examine historical records, it is essential to consider the societal and cultural context in which they were created. For much of recorded history, Europe had a dominant position in terms of global exploration, colonization, and influence. European powers embarked on extensive voyages, leading to encounters with different societies and enabling them to establish colonies around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This historical context contributed to European figures gaining prominence and recognition on a global scale. European artists, scientists, philosophers, and others were often the ones documented, promoted, and celebrated by the institutions that held power and had the means to disseminate their work. This historical bias resulted in their disproportionate representation in the annals of fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is crucial to note that this perception does not accurately reflect the contributions of individuals from other parts of the world. Around the globe, countless remarkable figures have emerged in all fields of human endeavor. For example, in Asia, we have iconic figures like Confucius, Lao Tzu, Rabindranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore, and Wu Cheng'en, whose contributions to philosophy, literature, and art have deeply influenced their respective cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Africa has a rich history of exceptional individuals who have made significant contributions to various fields, though they may not have received the same level of global recognition. One can think of Mansa Musa, a renowned Mali emperor, or great scholars like Ibn Battuta and Al-Idrisi.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that the availability and accessibility of historical records also impact our knowledge and perception of great individuals from diverse backgrounds. The historical records of certain regions might not have been preserved or disseminated widely, making it challenging for their achievements to gain global recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, it is vital to acknowledge that history has been shaped by various factors, including power dynamics, cultural biases, and the accessibility of historical records. While figures predominantly recognized as \"the greats\" have historically been white Europeans, this is a result of complex historical circumstances, not an accurate representation of the contributions made by individuals from other regions. By broadening our perspectives and embracing a more inclusive approach to history, we can uncover a multitude of extraordinary individuals from diverse backgrounds who have left their own indelible marks on human civilization.\n",

      "Q: Was “Combat Jack” a real thing? - I saw that during WWII soldiers where under fire for days in the trenches, so they had designated areas for soldiers would go to masturbate.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: As a historian, I can provide some insights into your question about the existence of designated areas for soldiers to masturbate during World War II, commonly referred to as \"Combat Jack.\" It's important to note that while soldiers' experiences in the trenches during WWII were undoubtedly challenging and fraught with tension, the notion of designated areas for soldiers to engage in sexual activities is largely a myth and finds little historical substantiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "During World War II, soldiers faced prolonged periods of combat in the trenches, enduring extremely stressful and traumatic circumstances. However, the idea of designated areas for soldiers to masturbate was not a widespread or officially sanctioned practice. It is more likely an urban legend or a story that emerged as a form of dark humor or exaggeration among military personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to approach historical topics with a critical lens and consider the available evidence. While soldiers' sexuality and coping mechanisms during wartime are valid areas of study, it is crucial to rely on verifiable sources and primary accounts to accurately represent historical events.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the notion of designated areas for soldiers to masturbate, commonly known as \"Combat Jack,\" is not well-supported by historical evidence and is likely a fictionalized narrative that arose post-war. It's always important to critically evaluate information and seek reputable sources to better understand historical events.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): This certainly wasn't a thing in an *official* capacity, but as they say, there are two kinds of people - those who admit to masturbating, and those who lie - and soldiers are certainly no different.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the era of World War II though, masturbation was *not* seen as anything positive. On a 1941 study on psychiatric issues within the military for instance, it was seen as a sign of a mental breakdown that could occur from \"Segregation from opposite sex\" for a \"normal\" man used to interacting with women regularly, and put on par with fears about using prostitutes... and repressed homosexuality. Ways to stem this were suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Preventive treatment will include public education as to the psycholog­ical needs of soldiers, more adequate recreational facilities in or near camps, and better arrangements for normal social intercourse between soldiers and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presumably if you are [able to play more volleyball]([LINK] it keeps you from feeling the need to touch yourself. Or other men.\n",
      "\n",
      "*But*, there was also some pragmatism. None of that of course is available at the front lines. While they were allowed to serve, women in most armed services were kept well away from combat, and recreational facilities are quite the luxury. The British at least recognized that there was such thing as the lesser evil, and that it was better to not actively discourage soldiers taking matters into their own hands than it was for them to visit prostitutes and risk VD. Or touch each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 1944 issue of the British Medical Journal, the following question was published in the letters section:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Would it be true and right to tell a man aged 20 in the Forces that masturbation was a lesser evil than fornication ? What are the ill results of masturbation?\n",
      "\n",
      "While the author of the response noted whether the moral evil of masturbation was on par with cheating on ones spouse \"must of course be left to the patient\", the answer went on to note that the soldier in question \"can be assured that occasional masturbation can be resorted to without danger to his health or to his future sexual life.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This was of course *serious business though*, and in taking oneself into ones' own hands:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;he should be told to adopt it deliberately, knowing that it is an emergency measure undertaken deliberately and after careful consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important distinction was that it *wasn't* used \"merely for pleasure\" but to relieve sexual tension at the point it became unbearable. It thus, of course, must be used as infrequently as possible, but nevertheless, it was better than the alternative, which might result in a venereal disease. This was hardly uncontroversial though! Not even a policy of encouragement, just a slightly tacit recognition that maybe it wasn't the worst thing *ever* resulted in Dr J. Luxford Meagher's letter to the editor several months later registered his severe disgust at such advice which would only encourage those of weak wills, and countered that *\"The remedy for all unnatural urges is strenuous resistance, reinforced by prayer\".*\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this tell us at this point? Most simply, that a \"designated masturbation spot\" was *not* official policy. There mere acceptance that it was something which might happen was tough enough to stomach, so the Army was hardly going to be setting aside jerk-off stations. But when you're at the front, and you are feeling that sexual tension which policy makers were so concerned about, what could you do!? \n",
      "\n",
      "In this situation, we need to be a bit less data focused, and the most we can really follow is going to be soldiers accounts. Although my skim through WWII memoirs turned up quite little of interest, given the specifics of your quesiton, I think a broader net to WWI is allowable, especially given your invocation of the trenches, for this there *were* a few excellent illustrations to be found. Magnus Hirschfield's \"The Sexual History of the World War\", originally published in 1934, provides some vignettes for us, most especially perhaps just how *haerd* it was to find privacy for such an activity when posted in the trenches:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Moreover, the practice of masturbation was virtually impossible  for my regiment while it was in position. Whoever has been in the field with front-line divisions knows the dense concentration of  men in the wooded positions which never permits men, and especially young officers, to remain alone. The various military duties at the post, sentry duty, the public nature of the latrines, the common mess, make it next to impossible to be alone and hence extremely difficult to go through the motions of peripheral, mechanical masturbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several accounts too are provided of soldier who apparently went so crazy about their *inabvility* to find time too that they just... whipped it out:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;A former Hungarian officer has described to us the case of a Bosnian who served in his army and had to be given a furlough and sent home because he would, in keeping with his low mental state, masturbate before all his comrades. When this unusually strong man returned from his fortnight furlough, during which he had had normal intercourse with his wife, he had grown strong and healthy and regained all his former power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this is easily topped by an account provided to by a French officer who recounted how:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;as he was inspecting the dugouts, he came to a dimly lit  corner where a tremendous crowd of poilus and a mysterious fluid caused him to stop at the threshold to see what was going on. Unseen he observed that they were standing around a young private (from the suburbs of Paris to judge by his accent) who was reciting something with the greatest elan and the most impressive vividness. The Parisian was describing his bridal night in the gayest colors, accompanying his story with appropriate movements of hand, body and head, and the most ludicrous tones, even to the imitation of a woman's voice. The excitation into which he had gotten himself was communicated to his comrades. \"As far as I could make out in the darkness, they seemed to be drawn closer and closer to him and to hang onto his words. Finally, on tiptoe, I crept nearer. After my eyes had grown accustomed to the semi-darkness, I was able to see clearly the purpose and effect of the vivid recitation of this youth from Panama (argot for Paris). The delighted and ravished poilus were standing around with unbuttoned trousers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These are, to be sure, highlighted in the work because how how extreme they are. Public masturbation and circlejerks were not the norm, or at least if they were, most people seemed to have kept mum, and although most soldiers probably did it when they had the opportunity of privacy - slim as that might be at times - Hirschfeld notes that it was still seen as something somewhat shameful and done only out of pragmatic necessity, and those who did it more compulsively being scorned by their comrades, writing that:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;as soon as the army entered a place where normal sex intercourse was possible, those soldiers, who continued even now to indulge in the common substitute of self-satisfaction, were mocked and jeered at by their comrades who forthwith took advantage of the opportunity for heterosexual intercourse. \n",
      "\n",
      "So once again, this illustrates the enduring point throughout, namely that masturbation happened. Frequently no doubt, but it wasn't something which was openly flaunted in most cases, and while it is impossible to survey enough literature to say with satisfaction there was *never* a designated spot for it, we can at least say that such an arrangement would have been a very local decision of a group of soldiers, and that it didn't reflect an especially common practice.\n",

Germanic tribes encompassed a broad range of peoples across present-day Germany, Scandinavia, and beyond. While it is challenging to provide a comprehensive answer, I can offer a general overview based on available historical knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germanic tribes were typically organized in small, closely-knit communities that lived in various types of settlements. The most common type of settlement was the village, consisting of a group of houses clustered together. These houses were usually made from timber frames with thatched roofs, although materials and construction techniques varied across tribes and regions. These houses were not large, often accommodating extended families. Communities were often established in strategic locations, such as near rivers or in fertile regions, to support agricultural activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Germanic tribes did rely on some hunting and gathering activities, they were predominantly farmers. Agriculture was a crucial aspect of their lifestyle, allowing them to cultivate crops such as wheat, barley, rye, and various vegetables. Herding livestock, including cattle, sheep, and pigs, also played a significant role in their economy. The Germanic peoples practiced a mixed subsistence economy, combining farming, herding, and hunting to sustain their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germanic tribes generally lived in close-knit social groups, emphasizing kinship ties, with extended families often residing together within a village. While there were variations among tribes, communal living and cooperation within the tribe formed a substantial part of their society. Each tribe was governed by local leaders, often elected or chosen based on their abilities and qualities. These leaders would make important decisions concerning the tribe's wellbeing and may have been supported by councils or assemblies of tribal members.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the lifestyles of Germanic tribes evolved and varied over time as they interacted with the Roman Empire and other neighboring cultures. The complex dynamics of exchange, cultural assimilation, and conflict resulted in a gradual transformation of Germanic tribal societies leading up to the Medieval period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Germanic tribes of the Roman Era were primarily agrarian communities, living in small settlements, engaging in agriculture, animal husbandry, and hunting, while valuing communal ties and local leadership structures.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): Information on the \"Germanic\" tribes on the fringes of the Roman world is relatively scant for much of the Roman Empire's existence in the west.  These various groups left little in the way of native writing, even less was written down contemporaneously to the events they ostensibly depict, and the works of Roman writers were hardly unbiased sources on the ways of their neighbors.  So historians are left with a few written sources that need to be carefully examined, ie the work of Tacitus and Caesar, or the works of Jordanes, and consequently much of our knowledge on these groups comes from archaeology.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Germanic tribes of the early Empire were quasi-sedentary.  They did not lead hunter gatherer/nomadic existences nor were they exclusively farmers, much less were they urbanized, instead they only temporarily occupied good sites for agriculture and livestock.  They would stay put for as long as the soil held out, likely decade or two, and then move along to a new site that offered greener pastures.  These group likely differed significantly in size, but early in the Roman empire they were unlikely to include more than a few hundred people at the absolute highest level.  Roman authors and their tales of hordes and throngs of Barbarians thronging over the border in massive armies tens of thousands strong, are just that, tales.  Urban development, and subsequently larger populations, around the Germanic world went alongside the development of Roman infrastructure.  The first areas to start an exclusively sedentary lifestyle would have been trade hubs with the Roman world, trading on the North Sea with Britain, along the Rhine, and only gradually penetrating deeper into Germania.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The societies that arose in Germania were dominated by a warrior elite who were able to exert, more or less, exclusive military power in the area and dominate the smaller groups that lived around them.  While many men may have had access to weapons, and indeed bore them, it is unlikely any but the highest rungs of society, those with access to Roman goods, were involved in politics.  Our historical sources are not clear on how these societies were structured exactly.  Tacitus, a Roman historian, claims that in these societies kings were hereditary and generals were chosen by merit of their skill at arms, but this seems unlikely.  Even more farfetched are 19th century romantic notions of Germanic freemen operating a quasi-democratic society.  It seems likely to me that political power was extremely transitory.  A single chieftain or warlord might wield a great deal of power within his own lifetime and provide his children with a more substantial advantage in the future, but there's little to actually indicate hereditary transfer of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should also take care to not attempt to categorize these different polities as ethnic groups.  Many of the labels that were applied to Germanic peoples by Roman observers are routinely resurrected to describe groups living in a similar locations centuries later,  but there is little reason to think that ethnic markers were as long lived as this.  Instead we should imagine these societies as much more fluid with tribal allegiances changing as different contexts arose.  The Germanic people of the early Empire were likely no more loyal to their \"tribe\" than they were to another that offered them a better life.  Loyalty and politics in this time and place were much more personal, with gift giving, serving in a warband, and so on being the means by which political alliances were maintained, not through ethnic similarity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The material culture of these people, the kind of houses they lived in, the goods they owned, and so on, were as a rule quite plain.  Indeed houses in the Low Countries and Northern Germany often consisted of little more than a dug in floor, a roof, and a small hearth.  Goods that they owned would likewise be rather simple and locally sourced.  Pottery, beer, subsistence foods, simple weapons such as spears or bows and arrows could likely be made locally, but more luxurious goods such as wine, armor, jewelry, and so on were likely Roman imports and limited to an extremely small part of the population, those with contacts in the Roman world whether they were traders, raiders, or mercenaries (and the difference between the three was likely pretty small).  As the Germanic world coalesced into larger polities this would change, but this was a development much later in time.\n",

      "Q: How did certain historical leaders come to be known as \"the Great\" or \"the Terrible\"? - How is a consensus reached among historians to give titles to some political leaders?  For example, why do we say Suleiman the Magnificent instead of Suleiman the Great?  What about other leaders such as Ivan the Terrible?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: As an expert historian, I am delighted to shed light on the process by which certain historical leaders are bestowed with titles like \"the Great\" or \"the Terrible.\" The usage of such epithets often stems from a combination of popular perception, historical circumstances, and cultural factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of leaders like Suleiman, who is commonly referred to as \"the Magnificent,\" the consensus to use that specific title has primarily been influenced by historical narratives and cultural traditions. Suleiman's epithet arose during the height of the Ottoman Empire, a period marked by territorial expansion, architectural splendor, and significant cultural achievements. His reign saw the Ottomans exert tremendous influence over a vast territory encompassing diverse peoples, which contributed to the perception of his magnificence.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, leaders like Ivan IV of Russia, who is known as \"Ivan the Terrible,\" acquired their titles due to a combination of historical reputation and cultural interpretation. Ivan IV's rule was marked by strict autocracy, multiple purges, and episodes of cruelty, giving rise to the perception of his tyrannical nature. It's important to note that these epithets are often a product of their time, and while \"the Terrible\" may seem overwhelmingly negative today, it was initially intended to convey both awe and fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consensus among historians regarding the application of such titles is not strictly a formal process but rather emerges through a collective understanding and acceptance over time. Historians meticulously study primary sources, conduct detailed analyses of a leader's achievements, impact, and contemporary perceptions to form a comprehensive picture. This understanding is then shared and debated within the academic community, leading to a broader consensus regarding the use of particular titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of a title can also be influenced by linguistic preferences, cultural sensitivities, and established conventions. For example, \"the Magnificent\" seems more fitting in the context of Ottoman culture, which often emphasized royal splendor and grandeur, whereas \"the Great\" could have different connotations depending on the specific historical period and region.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, designating historical leaders with titles like \"the Great\" or \"the Terrible\" is a nuanced process. Historians consider various factors such as accomplishments, impact, contemporary perceptions, and linguistic/cultural considerations to arrive at a consensus. These titles often serve as cultural markers, encapsulating the historical essence of a leader's reign.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): &gt;What about other leaders such as Ivan the Terrible?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to keep in mind is that the English word *terrible* has gone through a pretty big semantic shift since it was first applied to Ivan IV. These days, it means roughly 'bad, awful', and in the context of a ruler, 'incompetent'. Back in the 16th or 17th century (or whenever we settled on translating Russian *groznyj* as 'terrible'), its primary meaning was 'inspiring terror or dread'--roughly the meaning of the original Russian term.\n",

      "Q: Why didn't another dynasty replace the Qing Dynasty instead of the Republic? - Considering the Han people had been under Manchu rule for so long, wouldn't a new Han ruled dynasty been a natural new change? Was there such a movement to create a new dynasty instead of a republic?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912 marked a significant turning point in Chinese history. While it is true that the Han people had been under Manchu rule for around 270 years, the dynamics at play during the demise of the Qing era were more complex than a simple desire for a new Han-ruled dynasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Qing Dynasty faced immense challenges during its later years, as internal rebellions, external aggression, and corruption eroded its legitimacy and control. These factors, combined with the mounting influence of Western powers and the spread of revolutionary ideas, contributed to the downfall of the Qing Dynasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this period, several ideologies and movements emerged, each promoting different visions for China's future. The idea of a republic gained traction due to the success of republican revolutions in other parts of the world, such as the United States and France. Intellectuals and revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen, who championed the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, saw a republic as a more modern and progressive form of governance that would enable China to catch up with the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there were certainly proponents of restoring Han rule, the movement for a new dynasty did not gain sufficient momentum to compete with the republican sentiment. In fact, some influential Han Chinese figures, like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy, which would retain elements of Qing rule but with limited powers for the emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the success of the Republican Revolution in 1911, led by various revolutionary groups such as the Tongmenghui and the Wuchang Uprising, resulted in the establishment of the Republic of China. The ideals of nationalism, democracy, and people's rights resonated strongly with the general population, as they symbolized a departure from the autocratic rule of the Qing Dynasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential to note that the transition to a republic was not without challenges, and the early years of the Republic of China were marked by internal turmoil, warlordism, and foreign interference. Nonetheless, the establishment of the republic represented an important step towards modernization and the restructuring of Chinese society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the question of why another dynasty did not replace the Qing Dynasty is a valid one, the socio-political climate and the prevailing aspirations of the time favored the establishment of a republic as a means to break away from the past and embrace a more democratic and egalitarian future.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): Actually, the leader of the Republic of China the time did try to establish a new dynasty, for a short period of time during 1915, the Republic of China became the Empire of China.

      "Q: Why did Emperor Augustus choose the most sweltering time of year in Rome to name a month after himself? Why not in spring, when the weather is more pleasant? - So we know that Augustus named a month for himself. But why the time period that we now designate August? This is like one of the worst times of year to be in Rome. Do we have any evidence from that time period that explains his rationale? Do we know if he considered a different time of year? Thanks!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (gpt):    Answer: As an expert historian, I'm happy to shed some light on your intriguing question about Emperor Augustus and the naming of the month of August. While we do not possess any explicit documentation of Augustus himself stating his rationale for choosing this particular time, we can explore some plausible reasons for his decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before delving into Augustus' choice, it is essential to understand the historical context. The Roman calendar originally consisted of ten months, with no particular dedication to rulers. However, during the reign of Julius Caesar in 45 BCE, two additional months were added - July (named after Julius Caesar) and August (named after Augustus) - with the intention of recognizing the significant contributions and accomplishments of these influential leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Augustus succeeded Julius Caesar as the ruler of Rome, he continuously sought to solidify his power and establish his legacy. Naming a month after oneself was a way for rulers to leave a lasting mark and be remembered for generations to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, regarding your observation about August being a sweltering time of year in Rome, you are indeed correct. August is known for its scorching temperatures and is generally considered one of the hottest months in the Mediterranean region. So, it might seem counterintuitive for Augustus to associate his name with such an unpleasant time of year.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to remember that in ancient Rome, the calendar was primarily based on lunar cycles. The months were initially aligned with specific lunar phases, causing slight variations in their durations. When the calendar was reformed and made more consistent during Julius Caesar's time, the need to insert additional months led to adjustments that put July and August in their current positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is plausible to assume that Augustus, who was keen on maintaining continuity with the calendars introduced by his predecessor, did not prioritize the consideration of weather conditions when naming the month after himself. Instead, he likely prioritized the alignment of the calendar year with the cycles of governance and state affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, as the Roman Empire expanded, the significance of the calendar extended well beyond Rome itself. Different regions experienced varying climates, and the timing of pleasant weather would differ depending on location. Augustus may have also prioritized other factors, such as the agricultural calendar or religious festivities, which might have influenced his choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we cannot know for certain Augustus' exact rationale without direct evidence, it is conceivable that the naming of August aimed at aligning with existing calendars and best serving the greater political and administrative needs of the empire, rather than focusing on the weather conditions in Rome alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the study of history, we often find that decisions made by individuals in the past are influenced by a range of factors. Though the reasoning behind Augustus' decision might remain elusive, it is clear that his impact on the calendar endured throughout history, ensuring his name and legacy were engraved in the very fabric of time.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A (reddit): We do have evidence from contemporary(?) writers that suggest that the month was renamed after Augustus because it was a successful month for him pretty much. The date of the change is often suggested as being within the year 27 BC due to comments by Livy (*Periochae*. 134). According to Macrobius, the month was changed with the act of the senate who renamed it in Augustus' honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Macrobius, *Saturnalia*. 1.12.35:\n",
      "&gt; Next is August, previously called Sextilis until it was assigned as an honor to Augustus by the senate decree the words of which I have given below: 'Since in the month Sextilis Imperator Caesar Augustus entered his first consulship and led three triumphs into the city, and the legions brought down from Janiculum attached themselves to his auspices and good faith; and since in this month Egypt was brought under the dominion of the Roman people, and in this month the civil wars were brought to an end; since for these reasons this month is and has been most fortunate for this empire, it pelased the Senate that this month be called August.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Suetonius. *Augustus*. 31.2:\n",
      "&gt; He restored the calendar, reformed by Divus Iulius but afterward carelessly muddled, to its original order; in reforming it he gave his own cognomen to the month Sextilis, rather than to September the month of his birth, because it was in the former that he had won his first consulship and signal victories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it was renamed August because it was a 'most fortunate' month for the Empire, and given Augustus' fondness of positive propaganda, it is no surprise he chose such a month.\n",
