      "Model 1: The nucleus is indeed the location where information is stored. Genes are located in the nucleus (with some exceptions [e.g. Plasmodium genes], where they are located outside of the nucleus), and transcription of genes is the result of proteins changing the transcription of genes by binding (with help from their large-scale cellular networks -- as it was discussed in the question) those genes.

In contrast, sexual reproduction gains other advantages over asexual reproduction. These include becoming better able to reproduce when social conditions support it, multi-generation imprinting, and a species' immortality.
