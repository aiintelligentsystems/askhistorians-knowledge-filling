He ended up lending his talents to the Volscians in a bid to burn Rome to the ground, but with little success.

      "Holy presentism Batman! Your history teachers needs a refresher on the fundamentals of historical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was Lincoln \"racist\"? Well, first we need a definition of what racism means. Going by 20th century standards, Lincoln was definitely racist most of his life (went through some big changes toward the end of the war, called for much more equality for blacks). But by those standards nearly everyone in the nation, North included, was horribly racist at that time. There's no denying that, but then singling out Lincoln amounts to judging him out of his particular context, so it's meaningless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did he care about blacks at all? That's kind of hard to answer. Lincoln, like most Northerners at the time, believed in Free Labor ideology, which decried slavery for denying blacks the opportunity to benefit from their own labor. He \"cared\" in that he recognized the injustice of slavery economically, at least. But that also had a lot to do with securing Northern free labor interests and wasn't as much about the welfare of slaves themselves. He didn't (until very late, like I said) advocate full equality for blacks. Whether this means he \"cared\" is more of a value judgment than anything else, reflective more of what you or I think of the actions than anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did he issue the Emancipation Proclamation to economically sabotage the South? Your teacher is mostly right on this one, though he/she still seems to be making a rash and unwarranted judgment based on an oversimplification. The EP was the result of a very complicated process incorporating various huge factors. By and large it was an economic move: the South employed slaves to contribute to the war effort from day one building fortifications, serving in the camps in non-combat roles, and of course supplying the war from home with crops/supplies. Depriving the South of its slaves would deprive them of a labor force vital to their war machine. There was also a moral component connected to international politics: the South had been working hard to gain British and/or French international support. The EP, a statement declaring the war to have a new moral purpose, helped steer international powers away from the South, as their populations had decently antislavery sentiments. Even at home, ongoing exposure to the South in wartime was turning Northern sentiment further against slavery; having seen it for themselves, they were starting to oppose it morally on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind, especially with the EP, that Lincoln did not broadly throw around his Presidential power chasing after whims. He couldn't even if he'd wanted to. The EP, like the rest of his policies, were firmly grounded in how he felt the President's power could legally be used in wartime. Some grand statement that he wanted the war to be about slavery and that he was going to be the liberator of all American slaves would have fractured the North and driven him out of office. That the EP was designed to cripple the South economically has very little bearing on what his personal feelings toward slavery were.\n",

      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "1. A variety of factors. Most obviously, there was the fact that Napoleon came into power with the wars of the French Revolution still ongoing. The reasons for those wars have some relevance to your question as well: differences of societal philosophy, a warmongering attitude in France under a token of spreading *liberté*, a desire among the other nations to keep the status quo, and so on. Ultimately, though, it comes down to a balance of power. France was the most powerful nation in the early 19th century, and it simply wasn't in Britain's interest to allow it to keep the gains it had made during the Revolution -- especially while there was the threat of other uprisings across the continent. There was even a rebellion in Ireland in 1798 which saw French assistance. Napoleon also had an interest in having the wars continue as it ensured his popularity back home. He used propaganda to a great extent to ensure that even a defeat could come across as a great victory for France. The Peace of Amiens (early 1802) was really the closest the two got, but both sides knew that it was little more than just some temporary 'breathing space.' Through the Berlin (1806) and Milan (1807) Decrees Napoleon created his 'continental system' which sought to strangle Britain from trade. It wasn't particularly effective, but it meant that peace without Napoleon's defeat was even furthermore impossible. \n",

      "The French Revolution - Which socioeconomic factors caused it?\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "***Economic***\n",
      "\n",
      "The French Government was heavily in debt due to participating in a number of wars in the lead up to revolution, the Seven Years War and the American War of Independence. I believe that by the late 1780s the French had a deficit of around 126 million livres or so (don't ask me what that is in today's money, because I have no idea, but it was a significant amount). The War of Independence itself cost France 1066 million livres. Lots of people point to the extravagance of the monarchy (e.g. Versailles) as a reason, but that was more of a social factor (lowering the peoples' opinion of the monachy) than anything else - Alfred Cobban (I think) famously said \"the smallest war is more expensive than the largest palace\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, the bourgeoisie - the middle class - had been steadily rising in power due to France's prosperity under Louis XIV. This makes them more important to France's functioning, but due to France's feudal system, the bourgeoisie have no political power unless they purchase a noble office. This leads to resentment among the bourgeoisie, and a strong desire for change. Marxist historians will say that the French Revolution was essentially a bourgeois revolution, in which the old order of aristocrats was overthrown by the rising capitalist bourgeoisie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse, France had gone through a number of bad harvests in recent years. In 1788 it was especially bad as harsh weather destroyed a large number of crops and lead to a riot called the Reveillon Riot. So there were masses of starving peasants and urban workers, who started blaming the problems on the upper classes - accusations of landlords hoarding the crops were thrown around, and the people start to get violent.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Social***\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to social factors in the revolution. The starving masses start riots like in Reveillon or the Day of Tiles in Grenoble. This makes the king look weak because his troops can't control the populace. It makes violence seem acceptable and encourages more violence. Essentially, it makes the people think - due to the outcome of both affairs - that **violence works**.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also what Marxists would call a growing \"class consciousness\" in the Third Estate (the largest social group - anyone who wasn't an aristocrat or in the clergy). Going back to what I said about the bourgeoisie essentially keeping France and its economy functioning - they started to see themselves as the \"useful\" people of France, the ones who really make the country run, particularly after Sieyes' published his *What is the Third Estate?* (What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been so far? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something). \n",
      "\n",
      "The monarchy's prestige was weakening - the extravagant palaces are a symbol of the regime's power and glory when the people are prosperous, but a symbol of decadence when the people are starving - as they are now. What made this worse was the personal characteristics of King Louis XVI - he was rumoured to be impotent, he was a weak king, there were rampant rumours that his wife was cheating on him, and he just ended up looking like someone who couldn't control his wife and couldn't protect his kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "But social issues alone weren't enough to spark a revolution. Russia's had these problems for centuries, for example, and it was only until nearly the end of WWI that the people finally had enough of it. These social problems came to be seen as having **political solutions**. And that's the point when Louis and the aristocrats were well and truly fucked. It's also what makes political philosophy so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Political Philosophy***\n",
      "\n",
      "Rousseau, in particular, was an important figure. I've heard Rousseau described as the Eminem of the 18th century - he had what some would call a cult who hung on to his every word and essentially worshipped him, because he said what so many of them were thinking, and the things he said just seemed so true, which caused some people to have a huge amount of respect for him. His *The Social Contract* essentially implied that the king and the nobles were enslaving the people, and it was because of the feudal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time, coffee was becoming prevalent in France, so coffee houses came to be where aristocrats and intellectuals gathered. The philosophy of Rousseau, Montesqieu and Voltaire spread through word of mouth. By the time the Third Estate deputies declared itself the National Assembly, many of the bourgeois deputies had read or heard of those new ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what was so important about those philosophical works? Many like to downplay or underestimate their importance, but I would argue they are absolutely vital for a revolution to succeed. They present an alternative model of society. The people see them and they think, well, this very intelligent sounding fellow is saying we could do this, I think we don't need a king anymore! \n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, it is rather easy to draw links between the Enlightenment and the Revolution. Some will try to downplay its effect, and they have a point - after all, most of the French people were illiterate - but my counterargument to that would be that not only were the ideas spread through word of mouth primarily, but that the revolutionaries themselves (Mirabeau, Lafayette, Sieyes, etc.) were very educated and had almost certainly read those works of philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a whole lot of stuff I've missed, because the revolution was an extremely complex affair, even before it started. You also have the way tax was collected, the way French society was divided (into the Estates), the exile of the parlements and their subsequent return as heroes of the people, the dismissal of Necker and his subsequent return as a hero of the people, the long line of failed reforms under Controllers-General Calonne and Brienne...if you'd like I can elaborate on all these, but I think I've given a fairly solid answer.\n",

Judaism in Jesus's time was quite Hellenistic - even the Sanhedrin is just the hebrewisation of the name Synhedrion. Then the original Jewish-Christianity was destroyed in the Second Jewish War and Christianity was remade by Greeks living on Korinthos in Koine Greek. Christianity is mostly spread by Greek people in the larger sense (people of a Hellenistic culture, not necessarily having akhai, ion etc. ancestors) Already in the 2nd century Justin the Martyr defends Christ's divine essence using Aristotle's definition of the essence.

      "Historically, the church from the second century splits into those who try to disengage church thinking from the pagan society it grew up in (Tertullian or Cyprian for example).  However, some people thought that pagan belief foreshadowed Christianity - so you could get insight from the learning of the pagan authors.  Philo Judaeus believed that a general education was essential to the study of philosophy, which is in turn necessary for understanding theology.  This attitude was adopted by the Greek Fathers of Alexandria.  Clement of Alexandria pushes Philo's ideas - Augustine of Hippo pushes Clement and because he's so prolific and good at what he does, he has huge influence on Christianity.  \n",

You learned about those people if you were a scholar - and churches and monasteries held a monopoly on education (at least until the universities came along, and even then they were under heavy church influence) so it's no wonder they kept trying to fuse pre-Christian thought with Christian doctorine\n",

      "I'll echo khosikulu's response in asking for some more information from you - do you have any more specific sense of what interests you about the shipbuilding community/Titanic? (And is this an undergrad-level dissertation?) The shipbuilding community itself gives Irish historians an entryway into almost any topic they wish to explore. Often the best way to start is to start with a *question* you have that you want answered and then go from there. These questions usually come after you've done a little preliminary reading. And I agree with khosikulu on the point that the story you end up wanting to tell often comes out of the sources you find. (Even if you had a different topic/hypothesis in mind when you began.)\n",

      "As one example, you might look at the relationship between sectarianism and labour tensions/class by examining the shipyards. The [1907 Dock Strike]([LINK] is an interesting moment to look at, as Protestant and Catholic dock workers maintained a unified front during the strike and even adapted that year's Twelfth of July celebrations (a traditionally very Protestant and often triumphalist holiday) to appeal to and include Protestant and Catholic strikers. You could investigate [Belfast's 1919 Strike]([LINK] [Bloody Sunday (1921)]([LINK] etc etc etc..\n",

      "You might look at what \"Harland and Wolff\" and the shipbuilding industry *means* and *has meant* in Ireland/Northern Ireland in a symbolic sense (H&amp;W's [iconic cranes]([LINK] Samson and Goliath, appear often in murals, for example - what does this mean?). Similarly, what symbolic role has the Titanic played in Northern Irish political discourse? It has had an interesting evolution as it is now being pushed as a viable cross-community symbol for (an imagining of) a \"post-sectarian\" Northern Ireland. (Off the top of my head, there is a chapter on the symbolic meanings of Titanic in [this]([LINK] book.)\n",

      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Until the Civil Rights era, the Democrats were the main party of the South, representing agrarian interests and segregationist policies. It wasn't until the late 1960s that this changed, with Nixon deliberately targeting the segregationist vote with his 'Southern Strategy'. I'm afraid I can't speak on a more specific policy level, but it's a bit earlier than anything I'm familiar with. I feel it is probably due to the simple decision of whichever party was least likely to disadvantage them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, many legal victories won by the civil rights movement in the 1950s were due to Eisenhower-appointed judges in Southern courts. As Republicans, they were essentially outcasts from the social systems of the South - if a Democrat ruled against segregation, he would be out of the country club. If a Republican did the same, it didn't matter as he was already out of the country club. Even JFK had little interest in helping blacks, in 1963 the number one domestic issue for the Democrats was tariff reform. Before LBJ, there just wasn't the political will, so no real reason for blacks to vote Democrat.\n",

      "Why did blacks Mainly vote Republican between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Era?\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'd like to combine and smooth out some of the points made here already, if I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Reconstruction (1865-1870ish), there was a very brief period of military rule in the South, and in the meantime, blacks were given the vote and their ballot access was enforced by the government. Republicans formed the majority in the US government, and they supported punitive policies towards the South. Most Southern Democrats at the time were born from the Jacksonian Democrats, and their interests were tied to agriculture, and with it slavery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backlash to federal control and those punitive measures by the Radical Republicans in Congress were the poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and Jim Crow laws, which were supported and passed in state legislatures by Democratic-dominated Southern states. Black people took the blame, and federal government first became an institution viewed with suspicion and hostility, and as an instrument of the \"Northeastern elite\" (Sound familiar to anything you've heard today?).\n",
      "\n",
      "So for a time, Republicans were the preferred choice for black Americans, even if their economic interests weren't exactly served by the Republican Party. Also note that although they had an interest in punishing the South for *secession*, they didn't have an interest in racial equality. Views towards race were nuanced, and closed-minded attitudes were more common even in the North. The main thing is post-Reconstruction black people were highly disenfranchised in the South, and moved North for better opportunities, where the racism was present but not so prevalent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The change actually began with the New Deal and World War II. Black people enlisted in high numbers, and overseas they at first served in segregated units, but their deeds of valor (i.e. Tuskegee Airmen, among many others) became notable, as did Jesse Owens' Olympic triumph preceding the war in the 1930s. The New Deal was highly popular because it put the black populace to work, while WWII also provided jobs, because you could join the military and have a guarateed paycheck and 3 squares a day. The military is still a very popular option for America's minorities today. Postwar the military integrated, one of the first American institutions to do so, and as the US was still lead by a Democratic President (Truman by this time) the positive correlation between Democrats and good things for black people was first associated. So by the late 1950s the Democratic Party was already primed for having inroads to the black vote. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to remember is that in this era, the US was still much more regionalized. There weren't as many huge conglomerates, there was no internet, TV was in its infancy, and technology limited national media. So the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania was different from the one in Alabama, and so it goes for the Republican Party. The nomination process was different, and so were primary elections. All these seemingly mundane changes in how the parties operated and chose candidates are also important to how the parties shifted demographically. What we see primaries and conventions as now didn't look the same in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway two big movements then occurred in the mid 20th century that caused the exodus of black people to go from Republican to Democratic. A small step to this was Ike's appointments during his administration, as those judges would deliver some of the major, groundbreaking decisions during Johnson's Presidency. Moving along though, the civil rights era as we know it reached its apex in the 1960s. As popular opinion sided more with integration than with segregation, there was a split in the Democratic Party. Southern Democrats, seeing their interest threatened, and again the \"elite Northerners\" encroaching on \"Southern values,\" began to fall away from the rest of the party. These were the \"Dixiecrats\" and for a brief time, they were a party within a party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other major event wasn't so much an event, as it was an electoral strategem to get one guy elected. The Southern Strategy, as it's known, played on white, Southern resentment towards the federal government to elect a man (Nixon) who ran on curtailing and limiting federal encroachment, ending the Vietnam war, and a host of other policy stances. One of the ways the Nixon campaign primed the white Southern vote was through establishing closer relations with religious leaders. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Reddit it's common to see Goldwater's quotes about this, and conservatives are often quick to point out William F. Buckley's opposition to a religious wing taking over the Republican Party. What this shows is there was a religious wing in the party starting before Nixon's '68 campaign (Again, the parties were much more regional then), it's just that Nixon's people were smart to take advantage of it. They reapt the whirlwind of course, but at the time they didn't see it that way. As Dixiecrats fell away towards the Republican Party, these politicians, whom had great standing and were very popular in the South, kept their offices, other white Southern voters started to vote Republican more and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1980s you see the seismic shift in electoral votes for Reagan based in the South as evidence that the move between the parties was complete. You also note certain areas, especially Rust Belt areas, have large, Democratic strongholds, particularly in areas with high black populations. What's more notable is by the 1980s, in Southern black enclaves, voting is strongly Democratic; however, it's important to note that although on economic platforms and civil rights issues, black people favor Democrats, on social issues like homosexuality and abortion, there is division. Southern black Democrats often play on religious beliefs like Southern white Republicans do. It's just that the black Democrats focus on civil rights and economic disparity, while white Republicans focus on federal tyranny and degradation of \"Southern/family values.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The next big change, I think, will be based on the Republican Party actually moving away from social conservative issues in order to attract more minority voters, especially its stances on immigration. It won't ever be a pro choice party, but being pro life will be less crucial than it is now. Demographically the Republicans are in a place somewhat similar to where they were in the 1950s-60s; the population is changing its mind on key issues which are part of the Republican identity (gay marriage, marijuana legalization, defense budget cuts) and it knows it won't survive on a near-total white voter base. This of course means you'll see a demographic shift in response by Democrats as well.\n",

Also, the problem is compounded by cultural issues: the woman is in charge of the household, and if there isn't smoke seen coming from the hut she is considered lazy, so fires are kept burning 24/7.  However the woman and children are responsible for gathering firewood (often 1/3rd of their day is spent doing so), and nobody is interested in using up all their firewood just for appearances, so the fires are generally kept smoldering unless they're actively cooking something.  This results in smoke filling the hut pretty much all the time.

Many churches have been built in this fashion by well-meaning but misunderstanding missionary groups.  HFP is staffed in Guatemala by Guatemalans who are working year-round with the villagers to determine the best way to partner with them to help their needs.\n",

      "The idea that there was this great conflict between the Church and \"science\" is largely an invention of the 19th century, and anti-Catholic polemic.  In reality, the Church was basically the only game in town when it came to education for a millennium, preserved huge amounts of philosophy (natural and otherwise) from antiquity, invented the university, and the ideals which underlie science developed pretty directly out of certain strands of Catholic, later Protestant, theology.  Heliocentrism is the incident almost always brought up to \"prove\" this conflict between the Church and science, thus some quick things to remember: Copernicus was a priest, Galileo wasn't prosecuted for his heliocentrism per se, but his means of advocating it, particularly his use of Scripture for this purpose (especially as this occurred while the Reformation was raging), and his greatest scientific work was written *after* his trial.  And heliocentrism was by no means empirically obvious at the time when Galileo wrote.  In fact, it was less verifiable than its competitors.  \n",

Well because when I found a monastery on a chunk of land and install my nephew as the Abbot that land is suddenly involate.  The King can't take it, it can't be lost to the family through inheritance issues, it can't be granted away through marriage.  I've established a safe and important site which grants my family security *and* influence.  So statecraft.  But wait!  Just as importantly, the monks will say prayers for my soul and the soul of my family for eternity so that I can more easily to heaven.

The same could be said for agricultural methods such as three-field rotation, the iron-plough and the horse collar.\n",

      "One last thought.  It is important to remember that the idea of a 'Church' as some sort of monolithic lumbering entity is also highly anachronistic and unrealistic, especially for most of the Medieval period.  Through most of the Middle Ages the Church can more accurately be seen as a network or collective of people who theoretically work towards the same goal but in reality are generally far more invested in local issues and interests.  The Pope may have (or claim to have) great theoretical authority but on the ground the spread of that influence could differ widely from place to place and time to time.  Lets take the first crusade as an example.  Pope Urban II calls a crusade in 1098.  Very soon after 1000s of people of all walks of life head for the Holy Land.  But when we look at who is actually '*running* things it is nobles.  There is, for a time, a representative of the Pope there, but he has little actual authority.  Even more so for the so-called 'Peasants Crusade' where some random preachers gather a bunch of peasants and head off to get slaughtered in Anatolia.  They certainly think of themselves as part of 'the Church' but they are in no way officially affiliated and in fact are held in suspicion by the actual hierarchy.\n",

      "In the early 1960s the CIA was testing various psychelics at a reasearch center in the San Francisco Bay area (stanford?).  One of the participating subjects was Ken Kesey.  He was quite taken with his experience on LSD.  He was able to aquire some of the drug and used it while writing his book \"One Flew Over the Cookoos Nest\".  He and a few others also iniated other countercultural types in the bay area including a new rock band known as the Warlocks.  This band soon changed its name to the Grateful Dead and became the house band at Ken Kesey's partys on his property.  Before long they took these parties public as the Acid Tests which ran until LSD became illegal in the USA.  At the acid tests and the concerts that were played soon after, there would be \"trippy\" light shows to accompany the music and the template for modern rock and roll concerts with very loud amplification and an elaborate lightshow was set.  \n",

      "I love this one because it's one of those sources that too few people feel the need to question but it was, in all likelihood, at least partly fraudulent and meant to rile the troops. The medical attendant to Joseph Plunkett wrote in his witness statement that, around early April, Plunkett was talking about secret orders to disarm the Volunteers, and that the British wanted to arrest the Archbishop of Dublin, William Walsh:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The first inkling I got from him that there was something serious on was with reference to a remark he mad about blood-shed with Britain. He spoke of the British designs to arrest Archbishop Walsh – how far that rumour was true I cannot say – which excited him very much. He said it would be resisted by force.\n",
      "\n",
      "A version of the orders above finally reached the hands of the Archbishop's secretary, Michael Curran who was a supporter of the Volunteers and a close friend of Seán T. O'Kelly, on April 15. Many, including O'Kelly, were saying that the document was only drawn up in case of German Invasion, but even if that were the case it didn't make sense to isolate Walsh - the Archbishop was not a German sympathizer, nor was he of a mind to sacrifice lives for the prospect of a free Ireland. The Castle called it a fabrication, but the more radical Volunteers began to spread it around to rile people up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Curran reported that Walsh did not support the Castle's denial, and that he thought much of it was true, but if that was the case he did not do much about it. He was sick during the rising, so that could have been part of the reason, but if there was the chance he might be separated from the Laity, he would have at least sent a letter to the Castle, which he was never opposed to doing. Curran, then, may have been overstating the Archbishop's support - his statement was, after all, written in 1947, thirty-one years after the Rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Miller, who is another ecclesiastical historian, was one of the first to assert that the inclusion of the Archbishop likely indicated the document was, in part, BS. Plunkett and some of the more radical Volunteers knew that religion would help galvanize the troops, and so one of them probably slipped it in. \n",

      "the Napoleonic wars and world war two followed almost the exact same pattern. brilliant generals (napoleon for France, Erwin Rommel  for Nazi Germany). a European continental power taking almost all of Europe with new tactics ([LINK] for France, blitzkrieg for the Germans) conquering all of Europe setting up puppet governments as they went. both could never best England at sea, so England was always funding the resistance in both wars. both made the mistake of attacking Russia and not preparing for winter. and both went downhill immediately after failure in Russia. Britain landed major land armies only in the last section of the war that greatly contributed to the defeat of the land power (the Spanish campaign under the Iron Duke in the 1800's and D-day in WW2). the US contributed in a surprising way in both wars. the US supported France (the us was allies with France) by declaring war on Britain in 1812 for reasons that they could easily have let go under normal conditions, but the US was under pressure to help its ally other than loans. and in WWII, if it weren't for the surprise attack at pearl harbour, we would not have been involved.\n",

      "As I've studied the Aztecs/Nahua/Mexica, I've found many similarities between their politics and those of the modern United States. The general practice was to threaten the surrounding states with military force, demand tribute, and to flex the military arm (claiming that there was a holy mandate, a grand religious if not moral purpose, in favor of their actions) if the demand was met with refusal. A great deal of animosity toward the Mexica (the Aztecs living in Tenochtitlan, the political capitol of the empire) built up, and when the Spanish arrived, the surrounding states immediately pointed toward Tenochtitlan and told the Spanish that the Mexica were oppressive and needed to be overthrown, that they had all of the valuable goods because they demanded that the conquered states send them there. Even the states in alliance (an unbalanced alliance, dictated by the Mexica and not the states involved, with Tenochtitlan claiming most of the benefits) were hesitant to fight for Tenochtitlan during the Spanish invasion. I think that the United States would experience a very similar fate if aliens were to arrive on Earth and ask surrounding countries where they should look to conquer.\n",

      "I understand what you mean when you say that we are much different from what we were 1000 years ago, and on many points I agree, but many of the differences between people now and people then are superficial. People still essentially operate based on the same deep instinctive impulse to spread their genetics (and in the service of doing so, obtain food, shelter, and sexual partners), and if we look at over-arching themes it becomes easier to see the patterns of history emerge. These patterns are less observable when we look at societies and civilizations and their specific details, because those details are based in context and on chance, rather than the ultimate biological law to procreate and spread one's genetics as far as possible.\n",
