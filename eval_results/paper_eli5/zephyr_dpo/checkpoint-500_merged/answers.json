When it comes back up to above ~60 degrees Fahrenheit they\u2019ll be back to their old self in just a couple minutes. Sadly that means (if you aren\u2019t willing to camp out in the steam room for a few hours to keep them down) you need the lice dead before you exit the bath.\n\nFor crabs. With the right amounts of alkalinity (calcium hydroxide) you can kill them. OTOH you can kill them any time with soap. They get extremely soft in water (but so do we), so if you miss one they can just wait if you gently set them down in a pool of water for a second.", "baseline_answer": "Lice and crabs are ectoparasites (meaning they live on the outside of the body) and can only survive on a warm, moist environment, such as human skin or clothing. When submerged in water, they may become temporarily disabled, but they can still hold onto hair or skin. When left alone, they will eventually recover and resume feeding and reproduction. For effective treatment, over-the-counter or prescription medications are recommended, which directly target the parasites and their eggs. Regular washing of clothing and bedding, as well as avoiding close contact with infected individuals, can also prevent re-infestation."}, {"question": "What happened after WWII that changed the widespread racism and bigotry in Germany?", "answer": "1. The Nuremberg Trials. They demonstrated to the German people that the crimes committed by the Nazi regime were crimes against humanity that could not be excused, and that the people were accomplices to the same extent that the leaders were. This repulsed and terrified people, as they rejected the familiar and comforting notion that they were \"nothing butland people\" (a term coined by Himmler, to perhaps ease the perpetration of cruelty).\n\n2. The prosperous postwar economy. Germany has needed workers from many other nations, and the West German government actively brought in people from other European countries as guest workers. This brought different cultures, and they marred that comforting traditional fears about once neglected and unseen ethnicities.\n\n3. Finally, the recreation of a much more vaunted system of education, with good teachers, accessible books and an emphasis on individual differences and equal rights. This helped to get people (older Germans, too) accustomed to learning about other races, foreign cultures, and other theories and facts.\n\nIt was a whole matrix of things (a harboring of murderous people, a lack of education, a recession of foreign and dark people from academic learning and jurisprudence, etc) that caused an atmosphere of prejudice. Nazism was not universally supported, but it 'kind of took off' for a decade, so its perception has to be disaggregated into cause-effects too.\n\nWhat was so terrible in this is that the regime expelled Jewish professors from contributing to erudition. Some, like Einstein, were already in the US, others found themselves in Central and South America, getting rid of the best minds and their education and producing resources wasted sadly contents reflecting this answer.

These powers implemented a series of political, economic, and social reforms to rebuild and transform Germany into a democratic and peaceful society.\n\nOne of the most important reforms was the denazification campaign, which aimed to remove all former members of the Nazi party and their collaborators from positions of power and influence in German society. The campaign involved a massive investigation of the country's population, with over five million individuals being questioned, and resulted in the imprisonment and, in some cases, execution of thousands of former Nazis.\n\nDenazification was critical in breaking the elite power structures that had perpetuated the Nazi regime and breeding a new generation free from prejudice. It aimed to replace Nazi ideology with a democratic and more inclusive system that recognized the value and rights of all individuals regardless of their background, race, or religion.\n\nAdditionally, the Allied powers established a new democratic constitution, called the Basic Law, in 1949, that emphasized the value of human dignity, freedom, democracy, and the rule of law in German society. This constitution, which served as a foundation for the Federal Republic of Germany's constitution, placed a greater focus on individual rights and liberties, thereby minimizing the traditional prejudices that had harmed minorities and ethnic groups previously.\n\nFurthermore, following WWII, the occupying powers invested heavily in education, particularly in history, literature, and social sciences, that aimed to promote critical thinking, tolerance, and social integration. By instilling these values in future generations, the authorities aspired to foster a more tolerant and inclusive society.\n\nFinally, the country's expulsion of millions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe after WWII and the influx of millions of foreign workers from Southern Europe and Asia afterward contributed to the transformation of Germany's cultural and societal norms. These urbanization and migration processes demanded practical strategies for social, economic, and political integration that appeared as emblematic of progressive politics.\n\nIn conclusion, Germany's post-WWII denazification campaign, constitutions, educational reforms, and the mass migration of populations challenged traditional prejudices, stereotypes, and bigotry. The efforts transformed Germany's society, making it more inclusive, cohesive, and democratic, emblematic of a nation-state with a few flaws, yet standing tall in the spirit of civility and peaceful coexistence."}, {"question": "what exactly is edited when movie company's 'format the movie to fit the screen' and why do they need to boldly make that point known?", "answer": "When Hollywood movies were made, the screen size of most theaters was 35mm, and the aspect ratio was 1.85:1 (meaning each unit of width was 1.85 units of height).\n\nWhen films made for television started playing in theaters, typically they were 16:9 -- wider and flatter. This wider format was what setoffs the news stories about formatting movies.\n\nThere actually isn't much involved in the process. They look at how much will fit in that width, and they cut the middles of the frame. That's why the \"broadest\" parts of the image are in the two middle-bottom corners. By preserving the corners, they can preserve the dialogue, but they will miss parts of scenery. \n\nThe rationale for the news story is basically as rationale for faux trendiness. I'm honestly surprised by the response to my answer. Apparently people think preserving dialogue is *intoxicating* novelty. When, in reality, it's a minor inconvenience that's **ALWAYS WORTH IT**.\n\nHere's the thing. Everyone wants to sound \"confident\" and \"in the know\" about technical terms. \n\nBut the point of the \"format the movie\" that news was about was basically to say \"X movie is showing at Y theater. But instead of cropping the middle, we're cropping the ends,\" and the reason lawmakers love it is because it's another thing that they can lobby for. \n\n\"THIS IS PUTTING THEIR JOBS AT RISK!

WITH DOWNloaded movies aswell!\n\nLet's be clear about something. This proposition is a false equivalence intended to cause more concern than examination. No movie theater in America is **going** to give the slightest damn about a small sentence from a news article. \n\nAnd their equipment is almost completely NOT specific to their aspect ratio -- 99% of modern theaters use projectors that make 16:9 and 4:3 resolutions (roughly the aspect ratios of 1080, 4K, 720, and 1080i projectors) something that drops single projectors to potentially hundreds of movies per week in the same theater. \n\nAnd even if AMC really is scared and suggests tow supplies to make your dark room really use either of these aspect ratios at all times, because otherwise everything you run is optimized for either one or the other, you'd still run it roughly half of your movies and no less than that during your revenue droughts, even if you're getting everyone's attention right now. \n\nFinally, let's close out this thread of surprisingly vehement amount of discussion about a proposition relating to a LARGE HOW WAS INTERESTING, but we're not really wasting time. It's math, because surely it's a funded attempt to preserve specific implies it be as small as possible and you'd turn a little revenue stream slowly into extra revenue over a year even by scraping whatever arbitrary number of mugs were favored of consumers who buy things composed during movie intervals.\n\nNow that my interesting topic has been closed down!\nNote: A famous debate which brings this topic up that is hilariously undecided and that I'd like you to watch so", "baseline_answer": "When a movie is \"formatted\" to fit a specific screen, it refers to the process of adjusting the image size and aspect ratio of the movie to match the resolution and shape of the display it will be shown on. This is necessary because movies are often filmed in various aspect ratios (such as 1.85:1 or 2.39:1), but theatres and screens come in various shapes and sizes as well. In order to avoid black bars or distortion on the edges of the screen, the movie needs to be reformatted to match the particular display.\n\nThe movie company may make a bold statement about this process, such as \"formatted for theatrical release (1.85:1)\" or \"presented in CinemaScope (2.39:1)\" in their marketing materials or at the beginning of the movie, as a way to let viewers know that the film was created with a specific aspect ratio in mind, and that it's been properly adjusted to fit the screen they're watching it on. This allows for a more immersive and intended viewing experience, as the movie will look the way the director intended it to.\n\nIn some cases, a movie may also be formatted for home viewing on different aspects ratios, such as 1.78:1 for widescreen TVs, or 1.33:1 for standard definition TVs. Again, the company may make a statement about this to ensure viewers understand that the new aspect ratio may result in letterboxing or pillarboxing, but that the movie can still be enjoyed in its intended format if viewed on a larger screen."}, {"question": "Why is compression/normalization so freaking rare and/or difficult to achieve?", "answer": "1.

However, they are not always easy to achieve, and some people find them challenging for various reasons. Here are a few possible answers to your question:\n\n1. Lack of understanding: Compression and normalization involve complex processes that require a solid understanding of audio signals, music theory, and engineering principles. Many people who try to use these techniques without proper knowledge or training may not achieve the desired results.\n\n2. Over-reliance on presets: Some people may use presets instead of learning how to set up compression and normalization manually. While presets can be helpful as a starting point, they might not work for every situation, and they may mask the true potential of these techniques.\n\n3. Limited resources: Compression and normalization require high-quality audio processors, which can be expensive. Many people may not have access to high-end equipment, making it harder to achieve professional-sounding results.\n\n4. misuse: Some people may use these techniques too heavily, creating undesirable side-effects such as pumping, distortion, and loss of transient details. Proper use and application of compression and normalization are essential to avoiding these issues.\n\n5. Musical taste: Lastly, it's worth mentioning that compression and normalization preferences may vary from person to person. While some people prefer heavily compressed mixes, others prefer more natural and unprocessed sounds. It's essential to find a balance that suits the artistic vision and fitting for the genre.\n\nIn summary, although compression and normalization are crucial techniques for achieving professional-sounding mixes, they are not always easy to achieve, and some people may find them challenging.

Rejection - If you take an organ from your left shoulder and move it to your right shoulder, your body will still see it as \"foreign\". We have similar mechanisms in our bodies that can lead to rejection of donor genitalia by the recipient's body. A failed penis transplant in 2016 was actually rejected by the recipient's body.\n\n2. Embryology - Generally speaking, your genitalia will be formed to *represent* your gender. If you're a cis man, your penis will be thick and long. If you're a cis woman, your vagina will have a certain depth. These differences are presumably because of embryology, and cross-species transplants illustrate that they're based on embryonic development, not simply physical traits. It's fairly unlikely that a penis transplant from a cis male will work on a trans woman. It's conversely more likely that a clitoridectomy, or enlargement through other surgeries, would work.\n\n3. Psychological rejection - It's often reported that the patients who rejected the transplanted genitalia were aware that they weren't their own, and thus delayed social or sexual encounters for fear of being re-traumatised.\n\n4. Grafting issues - It was reported in both cases that some smaller, less important parts of the penis were also transplanted. They noted that the smaller grafts died less frequently than the larger penis grafts did. This probably suggests that difficulty issues with grafting does exist on a much smaller scale than that which would face a full-scale genitalia transplant.\n\nIt's possible that better ways to transplant genitalia will be discovered in the future, but none have so far emerged besides the penis transplant (which did not fix long standing erectile issues).

Some of these concerns include:\n\n1. Immune system compatibility: Just like with any other organ transplant, the recipient's immune system may reject the donor's genital organs, leading to recurrent infections, scarring, and other complications.\n\n2. Nerve damage: The complex anatomy of the genital organs, including the intricate network of nerves and blood vessels, makes it challenging to preserve their function during transplantation. While it may be possible to restore some sensory function, current techniques are not advanced enough to guarantee full or normal function.\n\n3. Psychological and emotional factors: Gender dysphoria is a complex and multifaceted condition that affects different people in different ways. While surgical interventions, including genital surgery, can improve the quality of life for some transgender individuals, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Genital surgery, in particular, can be a very personal and intimate decision, and it may not be the right choice for everyone.\n\n4. Legal and social implications: The prospect of transplanting genital organs raises significant legal and social questions, such as consent, confidentiality, and the potential for exploitation. Some experts also raise concerns about the potential for unequal access to these procedures, as well as the potential for cultural and religious backlash.\n\nOverall, while the study of genital organ transplantation is an active area of research, it is still in its infancy, and many of the technical, medical, legal, and social challenges are yet to be overcome.

While you might have learned which dots are which you still may not have extensive experience so mapping every single combination of dots that is a letter to the higher contextual awareness of a scene is difficult. \nSomething like lines of green and brown dots on grey can certainly be mapped to a mindscapes preview of grass near a pond with deciduous trees in the background.

If you phone determines that you have US service, you might lose a bit of signal, then it determines you have Canadian service. In this way the antennas get confused while you switch networks and randomly decide your true position as if you are in the US. This could lead to some poor signal for signal switching reasons, though your phone is clearly still within a network with good coverage.\n\nMore information: https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/d2x5yi/how_it_works_when_you_lose_signal_or_get_bars/\n\nThere is a signal level meter on your phone, 5 bars 3G is its max, today it is down to 4g/LTE or 5g. Your signal strength is measured by a unit called full bars of signal. Magenta is a signal bar, there are 3 of Sprint bars. Depending on location, time, etc, your signal level can oscillate around the displayed bar amount.\n\nYour device definitely determines that you at least have some type of LTE/4G when it shows four bars. You can test your current band by:\n- head to the BS detachments\n- 3G has only one, you should see a lower fee\n- 4G has at least 4 banks, with multiple bars\n- LTE has 2 to 12, as we have up to 12 banks each \n\nThis is nothing to do with a Canadian roaming agreement, or your phone swapping antennas. \n\n[Verve Editing] The reason why your 3G background is magenta is because it is the new Edge network that Sprint acquired some time in august 2014. Boost had been using a variant of Edge called eEdge which originally only showed up as Sprint and had a light blue background, but this was updated from Sprint to Boost before the November update, with everything looking the same way for a while until the screenshot was taken. The update slightly changed the colors of the bars and network backgrounds.\n\nAlso, the difference between a red Boost network and a magenta Sprint one is license info in the background, as well as text in the notification center. A red Boost network will have a notification when copying data over from a previous boost network, followed by a phone number with a red background. A magenta Sprint network will have nothing.\n\nAnd even though both the GE and Verizon prepaid will be around mid october, regions owned by Boost will still support their version of T-Mobile LTE bands, i.e. nobody coming from T-Mobile should use an app called T mobile Plans that will suddenly notify them that they have a new Boost cell phone number because of nationwide GE segregated users to T-mobile. The Verizon android is the one tracking T-Mobile in the bottom left corner of wherever you are but the second bit we were going to say a little bit later is currently over US territory.\n\nAs of October we would qualify for free unlimited calls and texts we would get. However, we have not specified the exact form this would take. Qualification for a 2018 mobile phone plus line was based on any provider, free unlimited calls and texts would also likely be free as they don't involve any lines on existing providers. The real money would come from free voice, such as Sprint's voice or T-Mobile's voice leading to prepaid free voice service.\n\nNext month we speak to US prepaid about plans to begin development of a more basic help site.\n\nAgain no solid plans, and an emphasis on voice service as well as some basic unlimited data features. We have not tried to use Sprint", "baseline_answer": "1. Your phone may be reporting the wrong signal strength. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as software bugs or interference from other wireless networks. 2. The tower you're connected to may be congested, which can cause slow or unreliable service even if you're showing full bars. 3. Your location may simply be far from the nearest cell tower, which can impact the strength of your signal. 4. Other factors, such as physical obstructions or weather conditions, can degrade the quality of your wireless signal. In any of these cases, your best bet may be to try moving to a different location or contacting your wireless carrier for further assistance. Additionally, you could try resetting your device's network settings or performing a soft reset to see if that helps. However, if the issue persists, it may be a hardware problem or a network outage, in which case you'll want to escalate the issue to your carrier's support team."}, {"question": "How does the ISS never run out of fresh air to breathe ?", "answer": "[Here's a video from BBC that explains how the ISS receives fresh air and sends out waste air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGq1p370m88)\n\nThe process is basically pushing/pulling air between the tanks and atmosphere, filtering the air inside the station, and recirculating the air within the station.\n\nThe air filters remove gases, fumes, pollen, hair & dirt from circulating the air, as well as kill most bacteria and viruses.\n\nThe tubes that push air to and from the tank lower the chance of bacteria or other environmental elements growing by lowering the oxygen availability. \n\nAir is gently pushed into tanks called carbon dioxide (CO2) scrubbers - located outside the living quarters of the station, Captain's Quarters are cool enough for them - which remove CO2 and liquid CO2 is collected into a vacuum tank. \n\nCO2 is collected, and oxygen and nitrogen molecular air is liquefied, compressed and also stored in tanks for air supply. \n\nThe liquid CO2 is then released into space or thrown out of the station through the SARJ tanks - Special Atmospheric Re-Entry Jettison - installed on the Russian side of the Station. \n\nOther garbage is put into SARJs located in the U.

If you just throw everything but the kitchen sink into your stew, it'll be strong, like a bridge. But if you flood the pot with needed materials, it'll be expensive, like overbuilding a bridge. So, you need to find the right balance. Add the ingredients you need to have a strong, healthy pot of soup, but limit the ingredients to keep the cost manageable. \n\nEach load (vehicle or pedestrian) has a certain amount of weight and each bridge has a maximum weight capacity. These will be calculated based on the materials used, the geometry of the structure, and the stresses that are predicted during its use.\n\nFor many points, these calculations can be done using simple math leading all the way back to grade school.\n\nFor many more points, simple math is too simplified and the answer needs to be closer to binary than decimal so then there'd be a computer doing the work.\n\nFor many points, the math is so complex that it's the application of differential geometry, special relativity, tensor calculus, etc. \n\nThen much of it is gut feel, experience from the size of the bridge and how heavy the weight is including the weakest locations in the bridge that you imagined might cause problems. And check his calculations you made.\n\nOverall calculating the weight limit requires far too many things to get the answer in a single equation to make the job easy.\n\nThe sketch above has a person crossing two platforms: With the perspective of the viewer. Then that might the center span of a bridge that the person might actually cross. That could apply to the point I was discussing. \n\nBut notice that distance is further left of the person than it is further right of the person. That's how the outer curve of a bridge could be thinner than the inner curve. Meaning, less weight limit further out.\n\nBelow, using that same perspective, this would be life chicken with very thick bones. The weight limit would not be important.\n\nThe basic red square could be a sufficiently strong rafter that could hold a very heavy load: \n\nThe bottom of the square could be made from thinner material with less strength.\n\nn the view at bottom left, the boundary near the top might say that up to a load of 120 pounds (55kg) can be accommodated.\n\nAnd the bottom left might say that up to a load of 35 pounds (commercial van) can be accommodated.\n\nAnd the bottom right might say that there is no load limit of any kind whatsoever.\n\nthis table might be able to be either all red dots or sufficient red dots to define as sufficient.

Load analysis:\nCivil engineers identify all possible loads that the bridge is likely to encounter, including the weight of the bridge itself, vehicles, wind, snow, and earthquakes.\n\n2. Structural analysis:\nUsing structural analysis techniques, engineers calculate the bridge\u2019s strength and stiffness under various loads. They study the behavior of the bridge\u2019s foundation, bridge deck, girders, piers, and other structural elements, to ensure that they can withstand the expected loads.\n\n3.

They check the design for any apparent weaknesses and ensure that it meets engineering standards and building codes.\n\n4. Construction:\nAt the construction stage, civil engineers conduct regular site inspection to confirm that the bridge is being built in accordance with the design. They also check for any unexpected geotechnical or hydrological issues, premature failure, or other undesirable consequences.\n\n5. Maintenance:\nCivil engineers oversee the bridge\u2019s periodic inspection, repair, and rehabilitation to ensure its performance meets its intended use for its entire expected lifespan.\n\n6.

Brisket is a cut of meat that comes from the chest of the animal, while steak is typically cut from the cow's rib or sirloin area.\n\nDuring the cooking process, the way that meat turns brown is called the Maillard reaction. This reaction occurs when amino acids and sugars in the meat are heated, which creates a complex interaction of chemical reactions that result in a brown color.\n\nIn the case of brisket, it is typically cooked at a lower temperature than steak for a longer period of time, which allows more of the Maillard reaction to occur.

This means that they are encrypting and decrypting your data locally on your device, not on the server, and the server can only see scrambled data.\n\nFirst, they take your key and encrypt it locally. This is a master key that unlocks your vault. They then run the process for every password in your vault separately.\n\nNext, when you log in to a password manager webpage or use the autocomplete feature in a browser extension, the webpage sends a request and receives an encrypted package. The webpage sends it to the password manager\u2019s server, which then decrypts it locally, looks up your vault, and sends a response containing usable data. That response is also encrypted until reaching your device.\n\nOnly the password manager employee who knows the key and password to enter the system (assuming they were very careful with that key piece of information) can access such information. Still, some password managers\u2014Dashlane, for instance\u2014use a Mac binding technique that requires the server response to be provided using the hardware security of local devices and not from anywhere else.\n\nThese password managers can also protect your data through several elite security systems. Some have encryption that uses randomized keys, meaning it would take a long time to break it, even with the most advanced hardware. Others force the user to input biometric data before logging into the system for added security.\n\nIn the case of sensitive banking information, you can typically set up two-factor authentication (2FA). That means that the password manager will send an additional verification code to your phone or email separately from your password. Only after that second code is entered, will you gain access to your account.\n\nOverall, these password managers employ complex security protocols to keep your data away from the prying eyes of hackers or employees if you\u2019re uncomfortable storing your information in a third-party storage environment.", "baseline_answer": "1) Most reputable password managers use end-to-end encryption to secure your data - this means that your passwords are encrypted locally on your device before being transmitted to the password manager's servers, and can only be decrypted with the encryption key that the password manager generates and stores locally on your device. This means that even if a hacker gains access to the password manager's servers, they won't be able to decrypt your data.\n\n2) Password managers also allow you to create unique and fairly complex passwords for every account, which significantly decreases the likelihood that a security breach at any single website will compromise multiple accounts. This is because hackers won't be able to use a single password that you use across many websites to access all of those accounts.\n\n3) Many password managers offer multifactor authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security. MFA requires an extra verification step, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or OTP (one-time password) sent via SMS, in addition to your password. As a result, your account is much less likely to be compromised even if your password falls into the wrong hands.\n\n4) Password managers also have access control options that allow you to specify specific accounts for which you want the password manager to remember login data and which accounts you don't want it to remember. This is especially useful with sensitive accounts like financial ones where you may want to manually log in rather than automatically.\n\n5) Finally, you can further mitigate the risk of password manager breaches by restricting access to your device and password manager account using strong, unique passwords, biometric authentication, and by enabling regular password updates.\n\nWhile it's still possible that a password manager could suffer a breach, the encryption and multifactor authentication that many of these services offer help mitigate the risk that attackers can compromise your accounts. It's also important to remember to not reuse passwords or login credentials, which increases the likelihood that a single breach can compromise multiple accounts. By following these best practices, you can enjoy the benefits of a password manager while still keeping your sensitive data safe.\n\nNote: I am not endorsing any specific password manager service.

Due to this, continence (the ability to control the body's waste) was regarded as highly valuable, both from a hygienic perspective and as a sign of one's intelligence - in 1761 an essay was published in France on \"Civility in excrements\".\n\nThis was further exacerbated by widespread use of chamber pots, which would become a dominant architectural feature in house design for hundreds of years.\n\nThis inculcated a society which valued control of bodily functions, like holding full bladder for long periods, which could have contributed to today's negative view of these processes.\n\nAs society has changed to value comfort over control, this may change, but it would likely be a long time because society has a long history of valuing, and therefore reinforcing, sanitation over comfort by fiat, a tradition that still influences current society.\n\nThe pressure put on meeting societal norms may also cause some people to deficate and burp in an attempt to relieve discomfort without drawing unwanted attention to themselves. This is one way that radical views on sanitation can foster an environment of conservative thinking and discomfort while reinforcing the reason why modern society is conservative toward these bodily functions.\n\nIn addition, animals communicate largely by scent, and smell strongly can indicate illness in other animals, which could put your entire group at risk if you're a hunter-gatherer\u2014 mistakenly dealing with an animal that is sick could be incredibly costly, both in terms of missed opportunity and, similarly, if you treat it properly, this could inadequately prepare your family.\n\nThe farting is most likely related to diet. Especially if food is shared between predator and prey, then the predator has to worry about the possibility of being poisoned\u2014 especially sharp diets that seem more poignant could be a sign of foul play against, say, your family. By farting the most, wolves or other predators can indicate that the food isn't poisoned, at letting others know that the food is okay to consume.\n\nTo further elaborate on the food, humans have diets that are selective of their foods, and if it's something that was found from ingesting poptions that will increase risky microbes and not obviously indicate it will so harm initially, we are prone to move away from it.

Perceived rudeness: In many cultures, burping and farting are considered rude because they indicate a lack of manners or a failure to control bodily functions. In some instances, these behaviors may be perceived as a sign of disrespect or a lack of social cohesion.\n\n2. Personal hygiene and cleanliness: Modern society places a premium on personal hygiene and cleanliness, and the release of gases or fluids from the body is often perceived as unpleasant or unclean. This social expectation can lead some to overlook or suppress natural bodily functions to avoid causing discomfort or offense to others.\n\n3. Emotional and psychological factors: There are also emotional and psychological factors at play that contribute to the taboo surrounding burping, farting, and other natural human processes. Some people may find these behaviors uncomfortable, embarrassing, or even humiliating, leading them to minimize or eliminate them altogether.\n\n4. Health considerations: There are some health conditions that may cause an individual to burp, fart, or experience other bodily functions more frequently than usual. In some cases, these behaviors may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, and their frequency or intensity may be cause for concern.\n\nIn summary, modern society frowns upon burping, farting, and other natural human processes due to social and cultural norms around perceived rudeness, personal hygiene and cleanliness, emotional and psychological factors, and health considerations. However, it's important to remember that these behaviors are natural and essential to human physiology and should never be cause for shame or embarrassment."}, {"question": "In US sports, why is it that there aren't tens of teams per state/city...like in European football?", "answer": "It comes down to cost and population. \n\nMajor league baseball costs a lot of money to run a team.

Geography: The United States is a large country with vast expanses of rural and sparsely populated areas. In European countries, where cities and towns are more closely packed together, it's often possible to sustain multiple football ( soccer) teams in a single city or region.\n\n2. Finances: Starting and maintaining a professional sports team is an expensive endeavor, especially in the United States where salaries for players and coaches are often astronomical. For many communities, it may be financially impractical to support multiple teams in the same sport, as it would mean splitting fan bases and revenue streams between them.\n\n3. Culture and tradition: The major sports in the United States have a long-standing culture and tradition, with many fans preferring to stick with their preferred team rather than switch to a new one. In Europe, where football ( soccer) is often seen as more of a national pastime than a regional one, loyalties may be more fluid and spread more widely across communities.\n\n4. League structure: The structures of American professional sports leagues are typically more centralized and standardized than those in Europe. In the United States, teams in a particular league are typically all based in a specific geographic region, while European football leagues often have teams from all over a country or region competing against each other. This centralization. Limit the number of teams that can realistically compete at the highest level in a single city or state.\n\n5. Athletic facilities: Building and maintaining state-of-the-art athletic facilities can be a significant challenge, especially in smaller towns and cities. Without proper facilities, it may be difficult to attract top-tier talent and win at the highest levels of competition, making it less appealing for prospective owners and investors to establish new teams.\n\nOverall, there are a number of factors that contribute to the relative scarcity of professional sports teams in the United States compared to Europe, but it's important to note that this dynamic is constantly evolving, and the lines between the two models are becoming increasingly blurred as American sports leagues continue to expand and international football ( soccer) gains in popularity in the United States."}, {"question": "What causes a motorcycle \"death wobble\" and what can be done to prevent it?", "answer": "Motorcycles don't 'death wobble' -they oscillate. Some common reasons and remedies:\n\nA fundamental characteristic of a free oscillating system is that the amplitude grows and the frequency decreases as the system runs out of energy (you feel this when you 'wind up' an unroped swimming pool slide and release the 'winder'). That is, you only experience a 'death wobble' when the oscillation has already started.\n\nOscillations like these do not have to be fatal for the motorcycle but they are very, very freaky and not fun. Here is a complete write up which describes some of the different causes and cures.\n\nMechanically, there can be a poorly functioning or stiff front fork, suspension. Frequently, there may be trouble in rear suspension as well.\n\nJust changing the rear tire, for example, can cause a new oscillation problem due to changes in load size, distribution, Post System Spring. Make sure your suspension is set up for your weight and load.\n\nElectrically, high electrical conductivity and change in road surfaces, temperature, etc., may cause secondary shocks which become magnified or caused oscillations.\n\nOscillation also will be felt from ABS brakes, which slow the bike better but require a constant 'line pressure' in the calipers. ABM stabilizer systems may do the same.\n\nThe term may have come from poorly adjustable or poorly designed suspension that causes uncontrolled wild oscillations. These oscillations are most difficult to control as the rider is likely going well north of the posted speed limit.\n\nThe fix is to reduce the power of the oscillations - regulate the system to the lowest possible power.\n\n\nThe rider should brake less or brake with power on the footpeg only, and brake smoothly to take full control of the brake effect. The rider should also make sure that the bike's suspension is fully adjusted and set up for the load.\n\nA simple phrase to remember is: \"Hard on the Load, Easy on the Road\". In other words, adjust the bike the front and rear suspension for the specific weight and load including yourself, so that the front and rear wheel battery are as low as possible. The front suspension should be soft and allow lots of travel so the bike can ride through inputs from the front wheel with little power. The rear suspension can be adjusted firmer so that small aperture are quickly dispelled but don't overdue it, so things don't get oscillatory. A stiff rear shock is useful to help control speed and to prevent rear end wobbles on the degree of throttle.\n\nWhen on the road, try and avoid any sharp or small inputs from the front wheel, and strike the road surface as square as possible, as you might on a bicycle. These inputs cause shock and oscillations, and they increase the Electro Magnetic oscillations.\n\n\nSo the rider can attempt to use the rear suspension extremely gently and above all else - keep an eye on the bike's suspension during the ride.\n\nBest of all is to ride as smooth and efficiently as possible and keep an eye on suspension components. Sometimes the front power valve tubes (or similar) need replacing due to wear http://www.elowham.com/Shop/Parts/Fork_Springs_Parts/Power_Valve_Springs now and then, which they should be replaced on a regular schedule - normal wear will be experienced by any part on your bike. Attempt to ride the straights were the riding conditions are constant, and the bike can react to them in the biggest possible fashion (if possible). Follow the road inputs that the bike likes best, and attempt to trouble shoot components that the bike dislikes.\n\nEver ridden off into the sunset with a stacked heap of motorcycle parts stashed away in the trunk of your car, all ready to go back in - and you're the only person on earth who knows all the bits you removed?\n\nWe ever feel like the paranoid schizophrenics in that movie \"Memento\"?\n\nGood links:\nhttp://www.alopezsgarai.com/dualshock\nhttp://www.oncircus.co.uk/protidot/\nhttp://www.alopezsgarai.com/xbox\nhttp://www.alopezsgarai.com/reactname/\n\nwhat are naked bikes and how do they differ from bikes with fairings? bare brake calib", "baseline_answer": "The term \"death wobble\" is commonly used by motorcycle riders to describe an extreme vibration or shaking that can occur at high speeds. While it is not an official technical term, it is a well-known phenomenon that can be both frightening and dangerous for the rider. \n\nA death wobble is typically caused by one of two things: a problem with the front suspension system or a tire balance issue. \n\nA suspension-related death wobble occurs when the front wheel of the bike begins to oscillate at a certain speed, causing rapid vibrations. This can be caused by a few different factors, including worn or damaged suspension components, incorrect fork oil weight, or incorrect setting of the bike's shock preload or suspension compression damping.\n\nA tire-related death wobble, on the other hand, is caused by an imbalance in the weight or pressure of the front tire. This can be caused by a damaged or unbalanced tire, or a bent or warped wheel rim.\n\nTo prevent or address a death wobble, there are a few steps that motorcycle riders can take:\n\n1. Check your suspension and tires: Inspect your bike's suspension components for signs of wear or damage, and make sure the oil weight is appropriate for your riding style and conditions. Check your tires for damage or uneven wear, and have them balanced if needed.\n\n2. Adjust your suspension settings: Take your bike to a qualified technician and have them adjust the suspension settings to suit your riding style and weight. Make sure the shock preload and suspension compression damping are set appropriately.\n\n3. Adjust your riding technique: Try to avoid sudden or jerky movements, which can exacerbate a suspension-related death wobble. Smooth out your riding style and maintain a steady, consistent speed.\n\n4. Consider upgrading your suspension components: Depending on the age and condition of your bike's suspension system, it may be worth investing in upgraded components to improve overall performance and reduce the risk of a death wobble.\n\nUltimately, safety is the most important concern when it comes to addressing a death wobble. If you are unsure about how to diagnose or address the issue, consult a qualified technician who can provide guidance and expertise.

This stage of sleep is associated with profound muscle relaxation and a lack of conscious awareness. During this stage, the brain's activity resembles that of someone awake, but the individual's thoughts and experiences are not consciously processed.\n\nSecondly, sleep talk is often associated with sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. In these instances, the brain is not fully asleep, and the individual may experience mixed-stage sleep, where they wake briefly during stages of sleep where their brain is more active. During this brief awakening, they may produce speech-like sounds or utterances that do not make sense in a waking state.\n\nLastly, the reason why these speech-like sounds may have a structure that is grammatically correct is due to the fact that language processing happens in stages within the brain, starting with non-sensical sounds and proceeding towards semantic meaning. Even in sleep, these stages are active, and the brain tries to construct meaningful speech patterns. However, because the individual is not consciously aware of their surroundings or the significance of their words, the sounds produced during sleep talk may not have any semantic meaning, hence the randomness.\n\nIn conclusion, people speak gibberish during sleep talk because they're in a deep sleep stage, where their brain is working to construct meaningful speech patterns, but they're not fully aware of their surroundings, or the significance of their words.

It's called \"birds and bees\" because both birds and bees mate and create new life.\n\nThe basic explanation goes something like this:\n\nBirds and bees have parts of their body called \"reproductive organs\" that are used to create new life. In birds, the male bird's reproductive organ is called a \"cloaca,\" and the female bird's reproductive organ is also a cloaca. When a male bird wants to reproduce with a female bird, they get very close to each other, and the male bird passes a special fluid from his cloaca into the female bird's cloaca. This fluid contains sperm, which can swim up and fertilize an egg inside the female bird's body.\n\nIn bees, the male bees, called \"drones,\" have long legs and a small body. Their reproductive organ is called an \"ectoproct.\" The female bees, called \"queens,\" have a large body and a long, thin reproductive organ called an \"ovipositor.\" When a male bee wants to reproduce with a female bee, he must first locate her pheromones. Once he's found her, he will try to mate with her by transferring sperm into her ovipositor.\n\nAlthough this explanation may seem simplified or inaccurate, it provides a general idea of how babies are conceived and helps to introduce the concepts of reproductive organs and reproduction in a relatable and age-appropriate way."}, {"question": "Why in winter, on sunny days its really cold, and cloudy days its warm?", "answer": "Because cloud cover traps warmth.

Solar radiation: On sunny days, the sun's energy, or solar radiation, reaches the Earth's surface directly. This energy warms the ground and objects in its path, which in turn warms the adjacent air. On cloudy days, the clouds absorb some of the solar radiation before it reaches the ground, causing less warming of the earth's surface and adjacent air.\n\n2. Cloud cover: When the sun is shining, clouds prevent some of the solar radiation from reaching the surface, which makes the ground cooler than it would have been on a clear day. The clouds also reflect some of the sun's energy back into space, which acts as a cooling effect. On cloudy days, the same basic process occurs, but the ground receives less solar radiation to begin with, since some of it is being absorbed and reflected by the cloud cover.\n\n3. Wind: Wind can contribute to temperature differences as well. On sunny days, winds may be stronger, carrying warm air from the sun's rays in towards the center of the region, creating warmer conditions in the center. On cloudy days, winds may be calmer, leading to less transport of heat, and colder temperatures.\n\n4. Altitude: In addition, if you are located in a valley or low-lying area, the temperature may be colder on sunny days, as the valley acts as a \"trap\" that keeps cold air from rising and warmer air from coming down. In contrast, if you are located on higher ground, you may experience warmer temperatures due to increased solar radiation.\n\nAll these factors contribute to variations in temperature on sunny or cloudy days, and the interplay between them can make for a complex and dynamic climate pattern."}, {"question": "Why are food, water and shelter not first on the human rights list?", "answer": "I'll provide a ray of hope regarding your American optimism. \n\nArticle 23  Protection of Work - (1) Everyone has the right to just and favourable conditions of work which ensure, in particular, remuneration sufficient for a decent standard of living for the worker and the worker's family.\n\nWhen you go back later gunning for equal rights Constitutional foundations and representation in the democratically elected Senate and House of Representatives and the ever private and public principles of safety and insurance like an army to protect your country the fundamentals of the free world are all there.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, identifies basic rights and freedoms that are necessary for the protection and promotion of human dignity. The Declaration recognizes particular human rights relating to aspects of life, such as freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, freedom of expression, and freedom from arbitrary detention.\n\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which was adopted by the UN in 1966, further extends these human rights protections, recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing, and housing, as well as the right to adequate water and sanitation.\n\nWhile food, water, and shelter are fundamental elements of an adequate standard of living, they are not considered inherent human rights in the same way that political and civil rights are. This can be attributed to historical debates around economics and the role of the state in providing basic subsistence needs. While some consider it the responsibility of the state to ensure the provision of basic subsistence needs as a human right, others argue that the state's role should be more limited and related to protecting the individual's freedom and liberties rather than providing essential goods and services.\n\nIn short, while food, water, and shelter are essential needs for human survival, they are not considered explicit human rights in international human rights law, but rather recognized as integral components of the right to an adequate standard of living."}, {"question": "Is sleeping in a fetal position (curled-up back) as bad for your posture as slouching for 8 hrs a day?", "answer": "Both are bad for your posture.

Slouching puts excessive tension on your neck, shoulders, and back muscles, which can lead to chronic pain and poor posture. When you sleep in the fetal position, your spine is curled forward, but it's generally in a more relaxed position than when you're sitting or standing for long periods of time. However, if you experience pain in your neck or back while sleeping in this position, you may want to experiment with different sleep postures to find what works best for you.

So before leaning against the wall, it was a straight line, Since you're applying weight at some point away from the point where the force stops being applied. Leaning against the wall you apply more force to the center of the lever causing it to hydraulically reposition supporting the weight better and more evenly. The force necessary was determined by the new location it needed to be in order to accomplish the goal of supporting your weight.\n\nTo make a real life example, imagine 2 guys holding up a wall. Both are 6 feet tall, but one is holding the bottom of the wall and one is halfway up. Of course the taller guy is holding more weight. Now allow the tall guy to release at half the height. The shorter guy has to hold both halves of the weight since the object and the wall are half as tall. He sees the weight he needs to support double what the should be. He's got to lean the wall using that new lever, which creates the opposing force holding the wall up at half of where it used to be.\n\nAlternately, Imagine a foot pounding the wall 1 mile away. The pressure necessary to keep that demand growing would be offset with the distance it took to travel through, the fact that by the time it hit the wall it was much smaller isn't as hard to overcome.\n\nWith an object leaned against a wall (me), to move my weight 1 foot away I have to offset the weaker force holding the weight up, and the opposing force pulling backwards. The material making up the wall and my object would receive a force splited by half from each side, but opposing forces from half the size. So instead of me applying the smaller force the wall is also creating half of mine back to me acting as a unit totally by shortening the distance.\n\nI'm no engineer. But I'm sure physics majors will come in and give you all the math.\n\nAssuming of course they weren't busy sitting on their high horse.", "baseline_answer": "In order to calculate the force acting on a wall by an object leaning against it, you need to know the following:\n\n1. The weight of the object: This is the force of gravity acting on the object. You can calculate it by multiplying the mass of the object (in kilograms) by 9.8 m/s\u00b2 (the acceleration due to gravity).\n\n2. The angle at which the object is leaning: This is the angle between the vertical (perpendicular to the ground) and the incline formed by the wall.\n\n3. The coefficient of friction between the object and the wall: This indicates the amount of friction that occurs between the two surfaces.\n\nThe force acting on the wall can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nForce on the Wall = Weight of Object * sine of Angle + Coefficient of Friction * Weight of Object * cosine of Angle\n\nLet's say we have a 50 kg object leaning against a wall at a 30\u00b0 angle, with a coefficient of friction of 0.6. We can calculate the force acting on the wall as follows:\n\nForce on the Wall = (50 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2) * sin(0.52 rad) + (0.6) * (50 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2) * cos(0.52 rad)\n\nForce on the Wall \u2248 415 N\n\nSo, the force exerted on the wall by the object is approximately 415 Newtons."}, {"question": "What does it mean for 5 trillion euros to be wiped off the global stock market?", "answer": "2 days ago ($1 USD was equal to 0.8 Euros) the market cap of the global stock market was \u2248 $60 trillion USD ($80 trillion Euros)\nToday 2 days later ($1 USD was equal to 0.7 Euros) the market cap is $58 trillion USD ($78 trillion Euros)\nThis means that over the course of 2 days: all the stocks in the world were sold at the equivalent of $1 USD per euro And $2 trillion USD (or 2.84 trillion euros) less money is in the stock market today than was yesterday.\nHot debate in economic academia burst into popular news.

When we say that 5 trillion euros have been \"wiped off the global stock market\", it means that that much value has been taken out of the stock market over a period of time. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a general economic downturn, a drop in investor confidence, or a specific event, like a company's poor earnings report or a political crisis. When the stock market loses value, it can have far-reaching effects, as many people and institutions have investments tied up in it. For example, people who own stocks in their retirement accounts will see the value of those accounts go down, potentially impacting their long-term financial futures.

Why was city of Berlin divided? Why wasn't it entirely a part of East Germany, since it laid on the East side?", "answer": "While planning for Allied occupation (U.S., UK and French), it was not clear what demands any of the Allies might make on Berlin. To maintain security in case any denied the others access, a \"4-Power\" zone was created, with one sector to each power. A civilian Soviet Zone was created as well but not controlled by the Allies until after the division developed fairly quickly. \n\nExpecting a quick resolution, the Allies entered Berlin together and played a game of \"reparations poker\" as it represents card in the poker when played last, to join the coalition, France moved to join forces with USA. They had been waiting patiently since the months before. \n\nInstead, Germany laid down to the upraised armies and unconditional surrender meant that the Allies were forced to disconnect and allow the new zones to exist as the story changed. Even with the former's bureaucratic machinations, it took until September to fully figure out responsibilities and fair credit redistribution and layout of zones. Expecting honest play from the Soviet's they increased the number of zones to 4 as a condition to the French's incremental acceptance into the coalition, guaranteeing Soviets receipt of a \"no-go\" zone to prevent access for occupying commanders of any party. \n\nBelow the non-coalition worked, after the English withdrew, when preparing for the increasing German influence, they were left with the city with no choice but to converge on the middle. \n\nLocated between the Soviets and Allied coalition, they were both afraid to have the city as the enemy and tired of the risk this geographic division presented to their newly formed agreement. Berlin's economy would often financially recuperate losses to shrink either and achieve parity, and night vision and tactics in both forced eyes to follow a future line as to when condition would arise as to how to absorb or removing them as equi-coalition. One in the same caused neither to act in violation in case hostility between the powers was needed. Partitions were issued through the city and entrances made. A city used in hostilities that stood nothing all changed left and destroyed reports from the war. Checkpoints remain until today.  \n\nFollowing several other conflicts, one in which Soviets changed the way they thought, favoring development over decomposition. The city was however to be in the East's conjoined sphere of influence. Finding itself caught between ideologies and positions, Berlin outshined as a moderate mix of international and German-values; setting out private economic ventures while welcoming visitors from two sides where 17 million people came only 2 years following a divide note which declared \"fall of the Wall.\"", "baseline_answer": "Berlin, the capital city of Germany, was located in the middle of the four zones of occupation that were established after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The allies (Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union) agreed to divide Berlin into four sectors of occupation until a permanent post-war government could be established. \n\nHowever, the relationship between the allies deteriorated in the years following the war, and tensions rose as the Soviet Union became increasingly aggressive in their occupation of Eastern Europe. In 1948, the Soviet Union blocked all land and water access to the Western sectors of Berlin, in an attempt to force the Western powers to leave. This event, known as the Berlin Blockade, led to a massive airlift of supplies to the Western sectors by the allies. After 11 months, the Soviet Union lifted the blockade and allowed access to Berlin once again.\n\nDuring these discussions and conflict, it became clear that the Soviet Union had different political goals for Eastern Germany than the Western powers had for Western Germany. The ensuing Cold War between the superpowers caused a permanent split between East and West Germany. In this context, the city of Berlin became a major source of tension between the allies. \n\nThe decision to divide Berlin was made during the Potsdam conference, which took place from July to August 1945. The conference aimed to settle disputes between the allies following the defeat of Nazi Germany. The decision to divide Berlin was primarily driven by East-West political tensions and historical differences between the occupying powers. \n\nThere were several reasons why Berlin was not entirely a part of East Germany. For instance, the Western powers had already established a government in the western sectors of Berlin, and they were not willing to give up control of their zones. Moreover, the Western powers didn't want to give the Soviet Union undue influence over the capital city of their zones, as it would have weakened their own position in West Germany. Additionally, given its strategic importance as Germany's capital city, the Western powers recognized that maintaining a presence in Berlin was crucial to their long-term security interests. \n\nIn summary, the decision to divide Berlin was primarily driven by political considerations in the post-war context. The Potsdam conference led to a division of the city to maintain the power balance between the allies and to prevent any one side from dominating the capital city. While Berlin was located in the Eastern sector, it did not become entirely part of East Germany because of differences in political goals, a reluctance to cede control, and strategic considerations."}, {"question": "Why if I multiply any random number with 9 the sum of that number is always 9?", "answer": "9 apparently doesn't have words after that so it's easy to remember: 9:9:9\n*If you run out of 9's your sum just becomes 9*+*9*+*i* where i is a number which isn't 9 so the your sum will always be 9 \n*You can calculate it via the formula 9*i = j where j is your sum but the formula we'll use is j=(i*i) using i=ending number etc.\nAnyway, whether it's the first formula or this formula, your sum will always be 9.

If you don't know any exponents that is fine, that's the easiest one to remember!\n\nFor 1^i, you really just have to know that 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1, 1^10 = 1, etc. i.e. 1 can be multiplied as many times as you want, however many times you multiply it it still equals 1, just takes longer to write (and possibly type on a phone) as the numbers get larger.\n\nFor 2^i, just remember the easiest two: I want you to remember, when you are cashing out rewards from a store, how many receipts you have as you go along. You have one receipt every time you purchase an item: so 2^1 is 2. Now if you make another purchase, you will have two receipts, so in your head you will count the first receipt as 'one' and the second as 'one', or 2^2 is 4. If you buy more, you will have 4 receipts, 2^3 is 8. No matter how large your rewards from that store are, just count whether you have 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. Receipts. \n\nIf you don't want to remember that, you can just remeber that every time you see an exponent in which the number is 2, double it (you know, the same way that you double your proverbial receipts). \n\nI hope I explained both ways clearly, let me know if I can help with anything else!\n \nComment: Does that method also work for 0, -1, -2, etc? \n \nAnswer: It can, but it's not really useful for those numbers in the general sense for math purposes due to them lacking the main properties held by numbers that can be made exponentially. In other words, exponential never prefers 0; and with negative numbers, for  each smaller exponential decrease in magnitude it gets exponentially larger, such that an exponent for our purposes is not a number that we normally deal with when representing something like money, time, or space, etc because it doesn't have these properties. The only thing that can be done with these numbers in terms of exponential calculus are equations termed logarithmic functions (which I will try my best to provide a link for in the future - it'd be too much work to do right now!), which act like inverse exponentiation and let you calculate the exponent needed for a given base number.

This color pigmentation will eventually fade away.\n\nOther species of chameleon will be a specific color when they die due to the fact that there is no more regulation of their hormones and the color will be the same as it was during its last successful warm blooded regulation.\n\nSo essentially you will find color blending (further established [source](http://tpodcast.com/mg_155_ecoli.html) ), memory coloring and under normal physiological rested circumstances a regulated coloring.\n\nEtiology could be a dying chameleon might change color due to internal bleeding ([In misible cases this may also happen]([source](http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/rising-natural/my-husband-is-bleeding-for-every-sin-he-ever-committed-4145162988.html) ) To metal poisoning ([link]([source] (http://www.elethan.com/chameleon_poisoning.html) \n\nNow, that is not to say that ligand connection so to speak (bonding agent) isn't something that could be theoretically modified whereby if the ligand couldsevered when the animal begins to decompose the melatonin would be released and the final color residue would remain.\n\nThere is an article about the metallic disorders [here]([source] (http://www.mhs.manchester.ac.uk/research/research_centres/ceuf/projects/met-poisoning.pdf) ) which might be helpful in potentially providing a more accurate solution to what is causing the colorization in decay.\n\nBut in short: Yes. it's final color is in fact the color it is before it dies.\n\nI hope I officially cleared up because as I understand it can change color for different reasons.", "baseline_answer": "If a chameleon dies, it does not change color as a result. The color-changing ability of a chameleon is a result of living cells in its skin called chromatophores. Chromatophores contain pigments that can expand or contract, depending on the chameleon's mood or the surrounding environment, which allows the chameleon to blend in or stand out.\n\nWhen a chameleon dies, its body ceases all biological functions, including the expansion and contraction of its chromatophores. As a result, the chameleon's skin maintains the same color it had at the time of death.\n\nIn summary, color change is not a postmortem phenomenon, and a dead chameleon will not change color."}, {"question": "Why is Kinetic Energy conserved in elastic collisions but not conserved in Inelastic collisions?", "answer": "Elastic collisions result from the animation of given potentials between the particles, while inelastic collisions are the result of the activation of potential energies to the activation energy, which means the inelastic collisions required more energy than what were provided to them thus energy is not conserved.\n\nImagine you have 1 kg mass moving at speed v1 impacting 1 kg mass at rest, an elastic collision results from just adding the speeds of the two masses/objects the resulting speed of the two objects will be slightly less than what would be, because there was energy transferred during the acceleration process.

The kinetic energy is transferred between the colliding particles, but there is no conversion of kinetic energy into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound. This is due to the fact that the collision is perfectly elastic, meaning that there are no sudden increases or decreases in potential energy, and hence the total kinetic energy remains conserved.\n\nIn inelastic collisions, however, some of the kinetic energy is lost due to conversion into other forms of energy, such as breakages, deformations, or heat in the system. Thus, the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved in inelastic collisions. Instead, the quantity that remains conserved is called the \"total mechanical energy,\" which includes the kinetic energy as well as any potential energy changes in the system. The total mechanical energy is conserved in all kinds of collisions, including elastic and inelastic collisions, as long as the system is considered as a closed system with no external energy inputs or outputs."}, {"question": "How did weed strains become increasingly more potent since the 70s?", "answer": "We have better ways of controlling the chemical makeup of the crop through selective breeding and better quality control through better storage methods.\n\nUp into the 60\u2018s and 70\u2018s, cannabis seeds were essentially being sold in baggies as is.  Even  birdseed was more likely to be higher quality than weed, simply because it was less heavy to ship, and could go farther with more variety available.  Mold wasn't really a problem unless the weed was shipped over the Atlantic.  Baggies would probably have seeds still in it, which would just grow into seeds after a week.  You may be smoking seeds by accident, even if you didn't deliberately plant them.\n\nToday, oppression and prohibition not only make the industry more profitable, but also operate to enforce quality control.  They *must* be of high quality for them to make it to store shelves.\n\nPlants are gradually getting bred to be higher in THC and lower in CBD by themselves.  A lot of that involves selecting the highest THC plants and breeding them.  However, it results in a plant with higher THC and lower CBD, as those two compounds aren't statically linked in some way.  So, breeding goes on forever and ever.\n\nIn addition to this we can now also filter out the THC compound through selective breeding in favor higher CBD concentrations.  I suppose this would result in less of a high, but less smoke free hallucinations.\n\nAdditionally, we've had huge advancements in storage possibilities, compared to the ancient weed you're smoking now, even if it's only 25 year old.  With the quality control in place, that older weed won't even make it out of port now.\n\nNone of this is new, but it has only really happened in the last forty years.  THC only increased that much in the last couple decades.

Could you provide more information on the advancements in weed storage methods and how they impact its potency over time?", "baseline_answer": "Weed strains have become increasingly more potent since the 70s due to selective breeding practices and advances in cultivation techniques. In the 70s, the average THC level in marijuana was around 1-3%, but today, it's not uncommon to find strains with THC levels above 25%. \n\nBreeders have been selectively breeding strains with high THC content for several decades, focusing on passing on the genes that produce strong psychoactive effects to their offspring. By doing this, they have managed to create strains that are much more potent than their ancestors. \n\nAdvances in cultivation techniques have also played a role in the increased potency of weed strains. Growers can now create optimal growing conditions, from temperature and humidity to lighting and nutrients, making it easier to grow high-yielding, potent plants. \n\nFurthermore, the democratization of information has provided growers and breeders with access to detailed scientific information about the plant's genetics and cannabinoid production. This has allowed them to more precisely manipulate the plants to produce higher THC and CBD levels. \n\nIn summary, the increased potency of weed strains is due to a combination of selective breeding practices, advances in cultivation techniques, and access to scientific information."}, {"question": "If hand sanitizer kills 99.9% of germs, what stops us from using that all of the time instead of hand washing?", "answer": "99.9% of what germs? Hand sanitizers are not effective against certain types of bacteria. Also, they don't get rid of things like dust and grime that would still be on your hands if you didn't wash with soap. \n\nFurthermore, many people rely on frequent hand washing for things like food preparation, cleaning, or sick people, where wash hands is simply more practical. It's still important to wash your hands really well after using hand sanitizer to kill any germs that may have evaded the first cleaning. \n\nLastly, too much hand sanitizer can be irritating to your skin, and can dry it out *a lot*. Its alcohol content combined with being applied from head to toe is not good for your skin. Cleaning your hands with soap and water does not doing this for you. \n\nSo, it's a pretty simple answer: *hand sanitizers and soap cover different things; one for when one or the other is simply practical, and the other is ideal for removing things that sanitizers can't.*", "baseline_answer": "1. Residue: Hand sanitizer can leave behind a sticky or greasy residue on your hands. This can make it difficult to perform tasks that require a firm grip or fine motor skills, especially when the weather is cold and your skin is dry. Over time, this residue can also attract more dirt and grime to your hands than if you had washed with soap and water.\n\n2. Antibiotic Resistance: Overuse of hand sanitizer can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Hand sanitizers commonly contain chemicals such as triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended to kill bacteria and prevent infection. However, this overuse can lead to the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to these chemicals, making it harder to treat infections caused by these resistant bacteria.\n\n3. Skin Irritation: While hand sanitizer is generally considered safe, some people can develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the chemicals contained within. Overuse could lead to increased sensitivity and irritation, ultimately exacerbating pre-existing conditions such as eczema or dermatitis. \n\n4. Timing: Hand sanitizer is a convenient option for situations when soap and water are not readily available, but it may not be as effective as hand washing in some instances. For example, hand sanitizer may not be as effective in removing certain types of dirt or grease as soap and water. In some cases, a more thorough cleaning may still be required, particularly for professions such as healthcare workers or food handlers.\n\nOverall, while hand sanitizer can provide a quick and convenient option for cleaning our hands, hand washing with soap and water remains the most effective way to eliminate germs and prevent the spread of infection. It is recommended to use hand sanitizer only when hand washing is not an option, or as a supplement to hand washing practices in certain situations."}, {"question": "Why does a bullet go through only 4 water balloons while an arrow makes it through 20+", "answer": "An arrow, because of the way it comes from a bow, is dauntingly more energetic than a bullet.

It got kind of rambly towards the end but I think I picked up on the main explanation.", "baseline_answer": "The reason why a bullet only goes through 4 water balloons, while an arrow can go through over 20, is primarily due to the shape of the projectiles and the materials they are made out of.\n\nBullets are typically cylindrical or conical in shape, designed to travel quickly and penetrate targets. When a bullet enters a water balloon, it creates a small hole, but it also causes the water balloon to compress or deform, which reduces its ability to resist further penetration. As the bullet continues to move, it creates additional holes in nearby water balloons due to hydrodynamic shockwaves.\n\nArrows, on the other hand, are typically longer and narrower, with a sharper point at the front. The sharp point of an arrow causes a much smaller entry wound in the water balloon, which slows down the hydrodynamic shockwaves and allows the water balloon to maintain its integrity. The narrow body of the arrow also helps to reduce drag and minimize deflection as it passes through multiple water balloons.\n\nIn summary, while both bullets and arrows are capable of penetrating water balloons, the shape and design of the projectiles have a significant impact on how many balloons they can pass through. Bullets, due to their cylindrical or conical shape, are more prone to creating large entry wounds and compressing the water balloons, while arrows, due to their narrower and more pointed shape, are less likely to deform the water balloons and cause multiple holes."}, {"question": "Is skipping more efficient than running?

This means nearly that the entirety of the lunar surface is covered in that same solid rock, which when a shot hits at high velocity disrupts very little, do to you guessed it, also being solid rock.\n\nThe problem arises when the meteoroid hits fast enough to cause the rocks to vaporise, both the meteorites velocity and the rocks (dust is bad for people, ash is bad for lungs).

Numerical simulators paints a picture of a distance along the platter between the actual speed of the head and the head speed needed to reach the average rate. \n\nBelow is the explanation I came up with from EEVBlog (video explanation of HD speed) from their release of say core, an application to open a decent data set representation from non stop videos. In my initial read this lead me to believe the discrepancy in speed I saw was caused by the fact that the beginning of the data may be lead by slower constants maybe not even required to achieve that build, tests, information perhaps for the final step to accomplish it but after character verification the data led themselves to a large good use for what have been embodied elsewhere.\n\nFrom what I saw, outliers in speed at an otherwise roughly stable number may be hinting at a very low, deactivated meta driver speed there. The Document output in the EEVBlog discord suggests that being there is impartial but doesn't show other stable points up to 170Mb/s and at lower points the program hangs and fails. It seems then their justification is for other factors that are within my notion of SATA schematic and not yet a lead to follow.\n\nfrom the core release link we do see what appears to be three instances with fairly stable gains at 195, 17 and 125MB/s and then the program hangs saying it can not release an instance for B since it is in already.

Buffer considerations: \n\nMost operating systems and disk drivers store data being read or written into a temporary buffer to improve transfer efficiency. The size of the buffer used for transfers can vary depending on the operating system and driver settings. During file transfers, data is retrieved from the buffer instead of the hard disk. The storage controller then releases the data to the recipient device. When large files are being moved between the two hard drives, the buffer may be completely filled during the initial transfer stages, and the data transfer speeds may touch the limit of the SATA/SAS interface (100 MB/s for SATA2, 3.0Gb/s for SATA3, and 6.0Gb/s for SAS). Due to this, the initial transfer rate will be higher than average. However, as more data is transferred, the buffer gets emptied, and the disk controller starts interacting with the hard disk to retrieve more data leading to a decrease in the transfer rate to the average rate derived from the bandwidth of the SATA/SAS connection.\n\n2. Hard Disk Read/Write speeds:\n\nAnother factor that influences transfer speeds is the read and write speeds of the hard disks. Ideally, if both hard disks have identical speeds, there should be no significant fluctuation in transfer speeds. But, if the sending Hard disk is slower than the receiving device, the hard disk will need to operate at its maximum speed, leading to fluctuations in the transfer speed. \n\n3. Connection Quality:\n\nThe type of connection between the two hard disks will also influence the transfer rate. SATA connections, for example, have a maximum bandwidth of about 6 Gbps, while newer connections such as PCIe and NVMe can transfer data at significantly higher speeds than SATA does. Moving data through slower SATA or USB connections will induce dropouts or speed hiccups during transfers, resulting in transfer speed variability.\n\n4. Temperature:\n\nFinally, the temperature of both hard disks could also cause fluctuation in transfer rate. Hard drives tend to slow down as they get hotter. This condition, known as thermal throttling can cause sudden slowdowns in the transfer speeds. If you move the drives between locations that vary in temperature, for example, moving from a cold air conditioned server room to a warmer location could result in variations in transfer speeds as the drives adjust to different temperatures.\n\nIn conclusion, file transfer speeds may fluctuate during big file transfers because of buffer considerations, hard disk speeds, connection quality, and chip temperature. Typically, transfer rates fluctuate from a fast start to an average rate maintained after the buffer filling is completed, followed by a slowdown due to the details mentioned above."}, {"question": "What is the leading scientific explanation for Homosexuality?", "answer": "At the most basic level, being gay or straight is all down to genetics. Our sexuality is something we are very much born with rather than something we are 'turned' into.\n\nHomosexuality appears to occur when a male fetus receives one X chromosome from his mother that is different to the one received from his father. They do have different variations. This is called the reverse lottery theory. Fetuses always recieve one X chromosome from their father and one from their mother, now the reverse lottery theory claims that roughly half of the male population have two X chromosomes from their father and roughly half have two different ones. This is very basic and I\u2019m not a biologist by any stretch but in the genes that determine sexuality, the genes from the mother are dominant and the father genes determine the gender even though the father genes which are inherited also determine a certain sexuality. The theory is that when these genes from the father are inherited, it creates a nudge towards a certain sexuality. It\u2019s basically just an explanation for why men generally have two distinct sexual orientations rather than a gradual spectrum. In other words why there is a clear gay/straight divide rather than one in which there are lots of shades of grey.\n\nThat was rather poor and I\u2019m not an expert on genetics but hopefully it helped.\n\nCan you explain the'reverse lottery theory' regarding homosexuality more in-depth?", "baseline_answer": "The exact causes of homosexuality are not fully understood, and there is no single leading scientific explanation. However, researchers have identified several factors that may contribute to the development of same-sex attraction:\n\n1. Biological factors: Some studies suggest that there may be genetic and hormonal factors that influence sexual orientation. For example, one study found that identical twins are more likely to both be gay than fraternal twins, which suggests a genetic component. Other studies have found that certain prenatal hormonal conditions may be associated with homosexuality.\n\n2. Environmental factors: Some researchers believe that early childhood experiences, such as the quality of parent-child relationships, may impact sexual orientation. For example, a study of Dutch families found that fathers who were more involved in childcare had sons who were more likely to grow up to be gay.\n\n3. Psychological factors: Some therapeutic approaches, such as psychotherapy and counseling, can help individuals who experience same-sex attraction form healthy relationships and overcome any related psychological challenges.\n\nIt's important to note that there is still much research to be done in this area, and the nature-nurture debate surrounding homosexuality is complex and ongoing.

These structures communicate with the parasympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of tears.\n\nTears are produced by specialized glands, called lacrimal glands, located above the eyes. These glands release tears in response to emotional and mechanical stimuli, such as when we're cutting onions or watching a sad movie.\n\nThe tears that are produced in response to strong emotions are called psychogenic tears, and they contain a variety of different substances, including enzymes, hormones, and antibodies, which play various roles in the body.\n\nIn summary, the process of crying in response to strong emotions is complex and involves communication between the limbic system and the parasympathetic nervous system, which leads to the production and release of tears by the lacrimal glands."}, {"question": "What do people mean when they say \"...because of the economy\"?", "answer": "- In 2007, our economy crashed and the value of houses went way down (meaning more houses are in foreclosure)\n- More houses are in foreclosure => more empty houses => higher crime rates in those areas\n- There are less families in those areas to buy new houses, and much less money to build new houses (increased unemployment equals less jobs, and less jobs = less money)\n- People thinking of buying houses don't want to buy a house that could potentially become a foreclosure, so the demand is lower.\n- Lower demand = lower price because house prices are usually how much the seller is going to get\n- When less houses are getting bought, less houses being built => less demand for lumber, drywall, and building equipment.\n- Can't sell as many houses, can't build as many house => lower demand for windows, plumbing, electricity, and more stuff.\n- This increases unemployment because there are lower number of jobs available\n- Increased unemployment = less houses getting built = lower supply of houses for sale/to build => larger price increase on houses.\n- Yes, prices went up and yet we're still below where we were in 2007 because the demand was higher before the bubble. \n\nSo pretty much, when  people say \"because of the economy\", they are really saying that something outside has influenced the demand for a product or service that has increased its price or something that helped sell it at a reasonable price. When something else affects a cost, it can be cause directly from the economy or from something else, like the price of gas. There are economic factors that influence how well things sell, like where the price of gas is. If it costs a lot to transport houses, then the price of houses goes up because it's more expensive to get them up to the store (or the convention/yard sale). \n\n[Courtesy: [/r/explainittotome](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainittotome/comments/17492v/why_does_the_price_of_everything_go_up_when_gas/c8281cz)]", "baseline_answer": "When people say \"...because of the economy\", they are usually implying that there is a macro-level economic issue or trend that is having an impact on a specific situation or decision being made.

Anthocyanins: Red fruits like strawberries, grapes, and apples contain a pigment called anthocyanin, which gives them their red color. These same pigments may also affect the perception of sweetness and tartness. Specifically, anthocyanins can make fruits taste less tart by masking the acidity. So, red fruits may actually be less acidic than green ones, even if they seem equally tart.\n\n2. Acidity: Green fruits like grapes and apples usually have higher acidity than red fruits due to the presence of malic acid, a natural organic acid. Malic acid gives fruits a tart taste and can contribute to their crispness. Over time, as grapes and apples ripen, their malic acid content decreases, making them less tart.\n\n3. Ripeness: Ripeness can also play a role in the perception of sweetness and tartness. Green fruits may be less ripe than red ones, which can also contribute to their tartness. As fruits ripen, they become softer and sweeter as their sugar content increases.\n\n4. Genetics: Breeding and genetic selection has led to some green fruits being genetically more acidic than red fruits. For example, green apples like Granny Smith have a higher malic acid content than red apples like Honeycrisp. \n\nOverall, green fruits may seem more tart than red ones due to a combination of anthocyanin content, acidity, ripeness, and genetics."}, {"question": "Why in Islamic culture is it ok to name your children after Muhammad but you can't draw a picture of him?", "answer": "Islamic culture is incredibly complex, and things such as this differ widely by country and culture.   However, there are some general reasons why drawing Muhammad is sometimes problematic but not sometimes ok, but naming a child after him is sometimes ok.    \n\nIslam, unlike Christianity, does not have an idealized representation of the prophet Muhammad.  Early converts would carry Muhammad around with them to physically show who he was, but the riddled history of early Islam eventually removed physical attributes of the prophet from the religion.   This became especially true during the time of the Caliphs, who were so concerned with not promoting idol worship that they put a blanket ban on drawing Muhammad.   \n\nLater on, the ban on drawing Muhammad returned, partly because it was tradition as well as because of the fact that the idea of promoting an image over essentially promoting words.    \n\nIn terms of naming children, this is a related issue.  There's less problematic here in large part because Muslims believe that the names they give their children have no bearing on the child's character.  Islam is a series of advocated postures (prayer, fasting) designed to purify the inner man. Such a string of practices cannot be taught through naming.\n\nThat having been said, there's some logic here in that you should remove the culturally-specific context for the names of individuals.  A name like \"Tariq\" literally means \"arrival\" in Arabic.  But the name doesn't focus on whether the person is a Tariq as in Quran verses, but as in a person who fits his or her context.   Terry typically isn't named after someone named Terry in history, but Terry from Walker, Texas.\n\nUltimately, the issue is that the names of individuals have a different relationship to them than the representation of individuals do.  Again, this varies a lot by culture and country, but in general, naming Benny Farrellstein \"Ben\" (named after Ben Gabbe) is fine while an image of Donald Trump is not.  (I'm prepping right now for a Punisher Halloween costume and I have to dye my face green before dawn or I'm in trouble. It's like Lenin in \"Red Dawn\" by Danny Boyle except he aren't a punctuated flattened eye with spikes and guns.)\n\nShort form: the context of presentation is different and so things vary widely.\n\nTL;DR: Drawing Muhammad is taboo in part because it's an idealized picture of the perfect Muslim rather than a mundane name; naming children after Muhammad is fine because names are not as linked to history and presentation as pictures are.", "baseline_answer": "In Islamic culture, it is considered a great honor and sign of devotion to name a child after the Prophet Muhammad. This is because Prophet Muhammad is highly revered and respected in Islamic tradition, and his name is considered sacred.\n\nHowever, the principle of not drawing or creating visual representations of the Prophet Muhammad is based on the belief that doing so can lead to idol worship and the loss of the true essence of the Prophet's spiritual message. In Islam, it is essential to focus on the spiritual and moral teachings of the Prophet rather than the physical representation. \n\nAdditionally, some early caliphs of Islam issued orders prohibiting the creation of visual depictions of the Prophet Muhammad for this reason. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran once famously said, \"In Islam, we don't worship idols; we worship one God. We only deem this (a photograph of Prophet Muhammad) as insulting and rude.\"\n\nIn summary, while naming a child after Prophet Muhammad is considered a great honor and sign of devotion, creating visual depictions of him is discouraged due to the belief that it can lead to idol worship and detract from the spiritual essence of Islam."}, {"question": "How are animals, specifically carrion birds, able to eat rotting flesh without ill effect?", "answer": "1.

Can you summarize how carrion birds are able to eat rotting flesh without getting ill?", "baseline_answer": "Carrion birds, such as vultures, have a number of adaptations that allow them to eat rotting flesh without getting sick. Here are a few:\n\n1. Strong stomach acid: Vultures have a powerful digestive system with very strong stomach acid that helps to break down and decompose the rotting meat. This acid has powerful disinfectant properties, and can kill off any bacteria or parasites that might be present in the carrion.\n\n2. Efficient nutrient absorption: Vultures have an enzyme in their stomachs called lysozyme, which breaks down the tough fibers in flesh and allows them to extract nutrients more efficiently. They can also extract nutrients from otherwise indigestible material like bone and cartilage.\n\n3. Immune system adaptations: Vultures have a specialized immune system that is adapted to fighting off diseases found in rotting meat. They have an increased number of white blood cells and antibodies that are designed to target bacteria and parasites.\n\n4. Decreased metabolic rate: These birds have a low metabolic rate, meaning they need fewer resources to function. This allows them to go longer periods without food, which is helpful when their main food source is carrion, which can be scarce at times.\n\nIn combination, these adaptations allow carrion birds like vultures to eat rotting flesh without getting sick or suffering from the lack of nutrients found in live prey."}, {"question": "Will video game graphics reach a 'point of no progression', where they cannot be improved anymore?", "answer": "As long as theres someone who wants to buy a more expensive product than whats on the market now, there will be people creating better and more expensive products.\n\nThere is always a drive to improve things, we just hit plateaus and solve one problem at a time. Look at smartphones, almost every \"new\" breakthrough is a refine of achieving what has been achieved through hardware breakthroughs and software years before.\n\nThe same thing will happen with video games, we are hiting graphical limits were technology has gotten us today, but no matter how common the limitations, some people will pay the price to push the boundaries a bit further.\n\nImagine super computers happening, now with the likes of small computers like tablet-PC's with this kind of technology built in, small home appliances could ensure higher resolution for all of us.\n\nI guess the only issue is that the hardware simply has its limitations until someone else finds an alternative solution. It might drive innovation as long as they invest in something that can completely replace those limitations, otherwise they will only recast the same limitations in a new direction e.g. Introduce new games that handle bigger resolutions without changes to hardware, minimizing older machines.\n\nSo while computers 50 years from now will never look exactly like rayman 4, this, again in some future, depends on the speed of progress. At the moment rayman 4 looks very intuitive compared to the \"dull grey shapes\" of computers 25 years ago.\n\nP.S. This doesn't mean that rayman 5 will be 60 times better than rayman 4, it should look only a little better. This makes it 2 to 6 times better than rayman 3, 4 times better than rayman 2 and more than 10 times better than rayman 1 (estimated from estimate in my head based on rayman 2 vs radium huge leap rayman 3 vs radium so other updates could be faster).\n\nI din't even think rayman is a system which conducts graphics. They do seem to get slightly better, but ray requirements have increased by nearly nothing in the seconds and years they've been out. This is because the real big developers require more system hardware solely to fill fan requests to run all their games at maximum quality. Bonus is they are right about this point. I plan on being able to run a PC at 15 graphics engines but am too young to fill credits when I need to shop around, but my demand exceeds that of a poor starving young malian village.\n\nSome older games like 007 Six Days in May does seem to improve but not by much. However the older games seem to get the shorter end of the stick when it comes to a lot of, metaphorical, game resources. I have a HP FHD monitor that runs all newer games at speeds of 60fps. older games run that at 48fps, 42fps, 32fps, 32fps. smaller res, 120fps doesn't work for newer games.\n\nI pretty sure IT will market the hardware between those older games for bigger, newer games a lot more frequent through a rundown as long as the hardware provides for smaller newer games used in a bigger newer game. I am sure they will single out the past HD speed, Obviously from the fact a fan of the company let himself show his disapproval I am sure they will debunk that finding easier and compensate for it with more research E.g Slowly playing a cooperative game that used the first game with edge limits and uses a google sketch pad to allow people in the back seat to play. agreement.

For example, ray tracing, which is a technique that provides more realistic lighting and reflections, is starting to become more common in modern games, and it's just one of many promising developments in the industry.\n\nAdditionally, advances in hardware, such as GPU technology and high-resolution displays, are continuing to improve, which will enable more realistic and detailed graphics in the future. There's also the possibility of new breakthroughs in areas such as neural networking and artificial intelligence, which could lead to even further improvements in graphics technology.\n\nOf course, there are also practical and economic considerations to take into account. For example, creating ultra-realistic graphics for an entire game can be incredibly time-consuming and expensive, which may not always be feasible for smaller developers or less commercially-viable games. Additionally, some players may prioritize gameplay over graphics, and may be content with less visually stunning experiences as long as the game is enjoyable to play.\n\nIn summary, while it's impossible to predict the future of graphics technology with certainty, it seems highly likely that video game graphics will continue to improve for some time to come, driven by technological advancements and the continued demand for more realistic and immersive gaming experiences."}, {"question": "when you buy a web domain who are you actually buying it from? How did they obtain it in the first place? Who 'created' it originally?", "answer": "There's only one registrar for each top-level domain (i.e. COM, NL, AU, BR, JP, CA, EDU, GOV etc.); for example for the \"COM\" domain, that registrar is Verisign. Verisign's main responsibility is to maintain the list of all domain name owners within the COM domain, and deal with various quirks of that domain, such as expiration notices.\n\nYou can't buy a domain straight from Verisign, however, although you can occasionally buy domain names from them that have expired and gone through auction.  There are lots of domain registrars that have been authorized to sell domain registry services (often by Verisign, e.g. 'Network Solutions') plus lots of other companies that have been given permission to sell domain names in specific domains (e.g. 'Namecheap', an authorized registrar for the.com and.net domains).  You simply pay one of these registrars (e.g. Godaddy, Namecheap, or Network Solutions) and it will get registered for you. The registrar does not get anything out of it, aside from charging your an additional % of the value of the domain on renewal, which it gives to the actual registry (like Verisign).\n\nWhen someone registers a new domain, they pay the registrar. The registrar allocates a contiguous chunk of their pool of registered domain requests to a registry (or another registrar, since many registrars use localized registries for various technical reasons). The registry (or registrar) adds the domain to their list and sends the customer the domain. They will maintain control of the domain until someone renews it (which could potentially be the original buyer, a subsequent buyer, or the company/person that registered the domain originally).\n\nIf the domain expires, then there's a good semi-random process to see where it goes when it is literally useless (i.e. Not used on any websites anywhere). The actual domain registry (the one you pay for the.com registry, the.org registry, the.me registry, etc.) will basically 'auction' it to another oganization that pays for the prime-numbered parts of its registry address. \n\nFor example, if \"xyz.com\" died and was back up for purchase, but I wanted to purchase \"xyz2.com\" so I pay Network Solutions $15 for it with expiration time remaining-- this expires and my twenty bucks goes to Network Solutions, they sell the domain to me and send me the appropriate details, and we are then all paid-- but, I'm so cheap that I wait until your $17 offer comes around and GET the $17 fee for each of sixteen (!) extra characters by buying \"xyz222222222222222.com\" from GoDaddy. \n\nBasically, if you want your own piece of the registry you pay that fee to your domain registrar, who pays the registry on your behalf. \n\nBack to your renamed domain original point, though:\nI know they're not real records, so I will spread this completely fake etymology story I heard about the origin of crunchy frosted flakes.\nWhen flakes were invented, they didn't know how to make them work properly. They tried to cover the flakes with sugar, and then squeeze them between two flat sheets, but they didn't work. The sheet didn't stay intact, and the sugar stuck to the left-over flakes. So then, the sugar problem was a bit more difficult. They tried a different method. They put the sugar into the flakes. Because the flakes needed to absorb some quantity of moisture, they absorb a lot of sugar as well. They tried to add the sugar again. The way flakes would break the sheets and crunch would cause them was cubic, and so were the crackling sounds they made. So... They named the new flavor crunchy apple and banana sounds. They bought out the entire company, so in that day they couldn't compare the difference between the sound. The sale was not size-determined, and somehow... Crunchy frosted flakes was more popular.

The initial registrants of many popular domains were early adopters who had a vision for what the Internet could become. Some of these domains, like \"google.com\" and \"amazon.com,\" were actually originally registered as simple placeholders, with no immediate plans for development into commercial websites. Other domains were used by organizations or individuals for internal corporate purposes, online bulletin board systems (BBS) or online gaming communities.\n\n3. Many domain names were also registered by speculators, with the intention of selling them at a profit to others who were looking to establish an online presence.

They complained because the price of oil is way too high.\n\n[ ] URL, research paper", "baseline_answer": "1. Refining and distribution costs: The price of gasoline at the pump is not directly tied to the price of crude oil. Refining crude oil into gasoline is a complex process that involves a variety of steps and costs, including transportation, processing, and distribution. All of these factors contribute to a \"markup\" over the price of crude oil.\n\n2. Demand: Gasoline prices are also influenced by demand. When demand for gasoline is high (such as during peak driving season or times of crisis, like after a hurricane), prices tend to rise, even if the price of crude oil is relatively low. Conversely, when demand is low, prices tend to drop, even if the price of crude oil is high.\n\n3. Market conditions: Other market conditions, such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory policies, can also affect gasoline prices even if the price of crude oil is low. For example, if there is a shortage of refining capacity or a disruption in the supply chain, prices could rise due to scarcity, even if the price of crude oil is low.\n\n4. Taxes: Some governments impose taxes on gasoline, which can raise the price at the pump.

The disc is generally ferromagnetic like iron or nickel\n\n2. Its state is most likely [ferromagnetic] when you heat it and [paramagnetic] when you cool it down.\n\n3. When the pack is being cooled, it magnetizes the disc towards the other ferromagnetic materials inside the pack (if it had a circuit or anything metal around it, it might stick to that) and this heat can be felt as I'm continuously magnetizing areas in the blanket where the disc is being held.\n\n[counterargument: A counterargument I can make is that if the heat is caused by magnetizing the pack as the disc cools, how do modern heating packs that do not contain a magnetic disc work? To my knowledge, it's not because they use induction based heating; not all pads work that way]\n\n4. The implications of a magnetic disc heating the pack [problems?] are that it may require more power than a heat pack without a magnetic disc would. While we heat our home with a small induction hob, it requires a powerful magnetic coil you could easily see.\n\n5. The syndication and incidental attractions from the magnet would also attract metal parts from inside the heating pad. More metallic objects means more events that could occur when the magnetized and heated pack comes to a different temperature compared to one that doesnt have one.\n\n6. The properties of the different materials are different when they're magnetized compared to those that aren't. The heat on a pack with the magnetic field would be released faster than packs whose heat is caused by [chemical interaction / applied energy etc.] because the magnetic field could increase the release of energy through electromagnetic induction or something.\n\nThat's what I found when I went to go google.

These packs typically contain a material called a \"thermochromic\" or \"exothermic gel,\" which is a type of material that releases heat when activated.\n\nThe tiny metal disc inside the pack, commonly made of iron oxide, nickel, or cobalt, acts as a catalyst in this process. When the metal disc is exposed to water, the moisture triggers a chemical reaction between the metal and the gel, activating the heat pack. The reaction results in the release of heat, which helps to soothe and alleviate muscle pain, soreness, and inflammation.\n\nThe amount of heat generated by these packs can vary, but most packs can maintain a heat level between 110\u00b0F-150\u00b0F (43\u00b0C-65\u00b0C) for several hours. Since they are reusable, users can simply microwave or heat them in hot water again to restart the process and use them multiple times.\n\nOverall, these heat packs with tiny metal discs offer a convenient and affordable way to soothe pain and inflammation, especially in areas where ice therapy is not feasible."}, {"question": "Why does UK English just say \"in hospital\" when US English says \"in THE hospital\"?", "answer": "The terminology \"in the hospital\" comes from the names of organisations where hospitals were more strictly defined and patients could sometimes be guests of many health providers, some official bandings of these facilities were sometimes called hospitals. \n\nFor example, Did you have to have been a member of the YMCA before you were taken for treatment at the YMCA hospital. \n\nSimilarly, public hospitals were often a division of ones organisations that looked after the elderly and disabled such as housing and nursing home provision. \n\nAlthough there were other terminologies too, because these organisations changed their set up so frequently that it became a mish mash. \n\nIn the UK medics and people came to use the term in hospital, for patients to be admitted it was as simple as being booked in to hospital for treatment. \n\nWe may use the term in hospital (technically referring to the facility as in our practice are located XYZ hospital in XYZ town) yet a family member may be in hospital for something. \n\nSo UK will say in hospital but if they really want to specify a practice or for theatre then they may say in the facilities of... Or in staff of... But that's fairly rare- 99% of the time most people will refer to in hospital and sometimes the name of the hospital.\n\nI live in US now, see no difference in the conversations between locals and myself. Sometimes Americans/Canadians ask me if their parents will be ok \"in...\" (town). But most would ask them if they are in the hospital. But it doesn't seem to have any problem in their comprehension. \n\nSo to clarify UK English \"in hospital\" is referring to the physical building. They would say \"in the facilities of...\" if referring to the whole scope of what's going on in the hospital. \n\nSimliarly \"on the ward of...\" if taking about the location they were being treated on. \n\nIn AU and US I have not seen \"in hospital\" much. It must be stated specially for the listeners to understand you are referring to the building. We would generally refer to the patients location as \"in hospital\" or \"hospitalised\" if we wanted to explain their condition somehow. \n\nSegraves seems to travel frequently too. Other than his view on \"in hospital\" which I noted as surface anecdotal I would say he's confused about many more things. I was disheartened to see that he only had individuals for communication of people who weren't born in an English speaking country. Other than that I disagree with many of the things he brought up.

To say that in a comment was hyperbole and to draw his logic that doctors and nurses would always use correct terminology excessively was a little over the top.\n\nBut that's just my opinion as an anesthesiologist residing in the united states. \n\nGoing back to the top, no there is no difference in meaning. \n\nTo have a wider picture in statement usage and where they could possibly mean something different you have to look at where the majority of the people speaking them are. That is in my opinion in the UK. And then the point becomes a little bit moot as to where it originated as this was not in any possibilities our hypothetical conversation posed. We are now ret-coning something into an opinion. \n\nThey don't inherently mean something different, yet the conversation is still worth having.\n\nWords matter to people. \n\nThey matter to people that strive to have a simple idea, needed in medical terms that make this whole thing a hyperbole passed off as truth. \n\nI know that segregates believes there is a definite difference between UK and US English. But in an academic setting you cannot use this as truth. We could sit all day and do not much but bandy ideas back and forth. To draw conclusions we have to have a committee of many more anesthesiologists that have come and gone. \n\nI just don't believe backword comparisons in a high quality medicinal setting as the best review.

In British English (used in the UK, Ireland, and some other English-speaking countries), \"in hospital\" is more commonly used, while in American English (used in the US and some other English-speaking countries), \"in the hospital\" is more common.\n\nOne possible reason for this difference is that in British English, \"hospital\" is used as a noun on its own to refer to a specific hospital, as in \"St. Mary's Hospital\" or \"University Hospital\", while in American English, \"the hospital\" is used more frequently to refer to a hospital in general. In other words, in British English, \"in hospital\" is more specific, whereas in American English, \"in the hospital\" is more general.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule, and both forms are used in both varieties of English. The choice of which form to use may depend on the specific context, the speaker's preference, and other factors.

Takeoff Issues:  Trying a mission in bad weather using conventional (low-tech) equipment would require that you get your plane to the show up before the weather stops it.  There is a certain threshold of catastrophic weather. If you try launching when you're exposed to it, you risk damaging the plane--it's a tough call between damage and simply not making it to the target because the weather is so bad you can't land once you've come back. The cruise missile can still make it there at low altitude, you won't cut it to the base in snow or below-freezing winds and rain.\n\nNo one has a more powerful this than Fernandes, check in the thread his knowledge on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lzaq1/why_dont_cruise_missiles_make_nuclear_bombers/lzax0dq Especially the warning/disadvantages to mass using them: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lzaq1/why_dont_cruise_missiles_make_nuclear_bombers/lzaxo6r\n\n\n2. All-Weather Landing: Most USA military bases for nuclear bombers need runways with a diameter of about 100meters. Due to the heavy payments and problems of building runways for new military bases, there is a dangerous factor. Such strip widening will lead to expensive runway base construction costs and the need to reconstruct by convention and airpower operations. Another 1 is the weapons environment: planes must navigate during missions. The missile may be used to pass the weather, but there is still integration: the missile is not equipped with navigation equipment in most cases, it is fused with a gps device using a mass missile, which is easy to stimulate and widely used terrorist organizations.\n\n3.

Cost: Cruise missiles are significantly more expensive than delivering the same payload with bomber jets. Cruise missiles typically cost $1 million or more, whereas bombers can carry multiple cruise missiles and other weapons for the same cost.\n\n2. Range: Cruise missiles have a limited range, typically around 1,000 nautical miles (NIMA), whereas bombers like the B-52 and B-1 can fly much farther, which gives them greater flexibility and range of targets.\n\n3. Cyber Warfare: Cruise missiles are subject to cyber warfare attacks, which can disrupt their guidance systems and render them ineffectual. Bombers are less vulnerable to cyber attacks because they have fewer systems that rely on external guidance.\n\n4. Targeting: Because cruise missiles are self-guided, they may not be able to hit very precise targets, particularly in a contested environment. Bombers have greater precision due to their ability to carry more sophisticated weapons and use onboard sensors to pinpoint targets.\n\n5. Deterrence: Bombers serve an important role in nuclear deterrence, as they are a visible part of a country's nuclear triad. Cruise missiles do not have the same deterrent effect because they are launchable from submarines, which are less visible and more difficult to target.\n\nWhile cruise missiles are a valuable asset in the modern navy, they are not a substitute for the capabilities provided by bomber jets. Each platform serves a unique role in modern military operations."}, {"question": "what's the significance of reaching ignition of nuclear fusion?", "answer": "Ignition of nuclear fusion is the point when the fusion reactions start generating more energy than it takes to keep them going. Up until that point, the fusion reactions are \"losing money\" in energy terms, instead of having an high return on investment. \n\nThis is why it is very hard. Normally, radiation forces you to add more and more energy to keep the reaction going, lowering your return on investment (return on investment is how quantitative economic terms are explained). \n\nWhy is having a high rate of return on investment important? You can't realistically sell more energy than you put into fueling it. Lets say we had a return on investment that was about 100%. Starting with $1, we would get $2. No profit, but not a big loss either. \n\nNow imagine we run a company that sells the energy output. We start with $1, and we get $2. This still generates no profit, but at least we should break even. \n\nNow lets say we get 100% return on investment. We get $2 off our starting $1. We make trivial changes to our operating procedure, so we sell our energy for $2. This time we make a profit of $1. \n\nNow imagine we get a slightly better return on investment. Drastically lower costs due to negligible, measurably low production cost directly related to the materials used in our systems. We spend half of our $1/$2 choice to operate the system, and end up with $3. Profit made is $1.50. \n\nWe now have a new improved way to generate profits, and now the technology is comparatively cheap than carbon based power plants. \n\nThis is why we want to optimize our power plants and reach a high return on investment. They are more expensive to build than current ones, but it will pay back in interest when top performers have no pricing to compare against in energy markets to sell the new type. \n\nIt might seem infeasible, but politics aside, for the first time in energy tech there is actual hope for a decent sale of energy to consumers in the future. We will also consider releasing more technology funds towards research than political interests. This will be done in order to ensure further technology advancements to lower costs as well. \n\nTL;DR Over time people will see how you can generate more for yourself by investing. Literally, by only lowering the price of power the old fashioned ways can lose massive amounts of money. This matter is all about the baseline cost of investments. \n\nNow one may say we need to rely on the heavy use of coal fired power plants and we will, for about 2 days, until an energy blackout happens. \n\nBlackouts are bad for cities to have and bad for countries too, take; * trends or acts in the past, British coal strikes, electricity sector strikes resulting from the closing of coal plants making electricity more expensive and important, and long down times documented. * You usually push past the point where you can do things if there is a blackout in the present US.

If ignition can be achieved, it paves the way for efficient, almost limitless and carbon-free generation of electricity from fusion, which could revolutionize the global energy landscape.

This led to a backlog in production and a shortage of chips. \n\nHowever, the TL;DR doesn't actually include the main explanation for the shortage, so I'll give it here: \n\nNAND flash chips are used to store data during standby mode, and they require power to function. In the last few years, demand for these chips has dramatically increased because they are used in a huge variety of small devices, from smart watches to backup cameras for cars. Unfortunately, because these chips are so small and are often used in situations where they need to be squeezed into tight spaces, they are more susceptible to electromagnetic interference. This led to concerns that if these chips were accidentally powered on in the wrong devices, it could cause serious problems like data corruption or security breaches. \n\nBecause of these concerns, manufacturers had to implement new testing and quality control measures to catch any potential issues before mass production, which slowed down the production process and caused a backlog of orders that took several months to clear out.", "baseline_answer": "The shortage of NAND chips (a type of memory used in many electronic devices) has been a persistent issue in the tech industry in the last two years. The root cause of the shortage is a complex combination of factors, including:\n\n1. High Demand: The rapid growth of the data storage industry, driven by increasing demand for smartphones, data centers, and IoT devices, has led to a surge in demand for NAND chips.\n\n2. Capacity Constraints: The semiconductor industry has been struggling to ramp up production capacity to meet this demand. This is partly because the production process for NAND chips is complex and costly, requiring large capital investments and years of development to achieve the necessary process maturity.\n\n3. Redistribution of Supply: In addition to the high demand, there has been a redistribution of NAND chip supply due to changing market dynamics. For example, the increase in demand for solid-state drives (SSDs) has led to a shift in supply towards SSD manufacturers rather than traditional NAND flash vendors.\n\n4. Supply Chain Disruptions: Natural disasters (such as floods and fires) and geopolitical events (such as trade disputes) have disrupted the supply chain, further exacerbating the shortage.\n\nAs a result of these factors, NAND chip prices have spiked, and many device manufacturers have had to adopt cost-cutting measures, such as reducing flash storage capacity in their products, in order to maintain profitability. The shortage has also led to a growing concern about the industry's ability to meet future demand as the adoption of memory-intensive technologies like 5G, AI, and autonomous driving continue to grow."}, {"question": "What creates the feeling for a person that they are being watched?", "answer": "When we process information the brain will try to find extremely high contrast or bright objects.\n\nIf it's just a bright light, that's all that it is.

Evolution: Being wary of potential threats is a basic human instinct passed down from our evolutionary ancestors who faced real danger from predators. This instinct manifests as a heightened sense of awareness and an inclination to perceive potential threats, even in the absence of evidence.\n\n2. Cultural conditioning: Early in our developmental years, parents and caregivers create rural scenes using pictures and children's books in which kids are taught that there are potential predators everywhere.

Each type of multivitamin is more or less tailored for people that have certain deficacies. If your underlying cause is for example an iron deficiency or a b12 deficiency, there are multivitamins for that. Until only a few years ago my son had vitamin D deficiency, this could be cured by giving him with vitamin D supplements. The multivitamin they used for him contained only vitamin D.\n\n3. People with underlying causes that need strong medications such as insulin for diabetes can better manage these diseases with medicines than with dietary supplements.

If so, what causes that to happen instead of taking a little while for your brain to actually \"turn off\" from the lack of oxygen?", "answer": "Some people believe that you are 'knocked out' for only half a second when you lose consciousness and therefore the heart also stops very quickly. \n\nIn reality the heart pumps longer than we think it does, like 5-10 seconds. Once the heart stops pumping, it does so instantaneously. The 'hard stop' of the heart is what leads to the unconsciousness, not the heart stopping.  The threat to your brain is immediately, so by the time you even begin to notice that things might be wrong there isn't enough oxygen on board after just a couple of heart beats.\n\nBacking this up, studies that measured electrical brain function of dying patients found that activity dies down more quickly than the heart stops pumping. \n\n\nIrreversibility (of brain damage) depends mostly on the length of time there was between when the oxygen is cut off and when good blood flow is restored to the area of the brain (from roughly 4 minutes back up the scientific references list). Air damage seems to mesh with but not actually immediately kill brain cells (as studies with fish for example show). The reason the brain recovers so poorly in oxygen deprivation has a lot to with changes in calcium flux in the pores of brain cells which is a lot more complicated than air deprivation (a quick look at the key word in this citation should give you a sense of the breadth of the topic).

The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly, and without it, brain cells can start to die within minutes.\n\nThe time it takes for someone to lose consciousness after their heart stops depends on a number of factors, such as how healthy their brain is at the time, how quickly their heart stops, and how quickly they receive medical attention. In some cases, a person may lose consciousness almost immediately, but in other cases, it can take several minutes.\n\nOnce someone loses consciousness, they are in a state called \"clinical death,\" where their brain activity has stopped. However, in some cases, it's possible to resuscitate someone who has reached this point, particularly if medical treatment is given promptly. If the person's heart and breathing stop for too long, however, brain cells will start to die due to lack of oxygen, rendering any resuscitation attempts fruitless.\n\nIn summary, the brain can't survive for long without oxygen, but the precise time it takes for someone to lose consciousness and die varies from person to person. The main reason people die after their heart stops is due to brain cell death, rather than an instant and painless release."}, {"question": "how this is possible: \"Your PIN will be texted to you...for security the message will be automatically deleted two days later\"", "answer": "99.9% my PIN is already deleted two days after it gets sent to me.

Card processors store the credit card numbers that they receive.\n\nYeas any number of the big credit card companies/processors are databreached. Typically everyone who is at risk gets a new card.\n\nQuestion for later: Why are these services so terrible at baiting and Switching events?\nAnswer: I played in multiple affiliate systems' betting pools where they jack the price on the haul by 100 times minimum seconds before showing you what you can win. Start playing $1 on random bets!\n\nIt can blow up to $main pot + $person pot + $interest accrued + $community pool or extra amount added. It could be Wowthatismassive$80+ for just $1!\n\nAnd it can win at the last 30 seconds. It's just considered lucky to beat the odds past $0.50 on almost any bet, since that's just the average you pay off even hand.\n\nAverages just start with $0.20 though, so better start small. Most testing games on it on their side are spent averaging how much one puts down compared to how many wins someone gets. It's meant to create a richer game out of everyone chipping on to the same pot, even if it does cost more for an investor than usual past 20 dollar amounts.\n\nThe CPUs they have suck, they also have poor strategy. Some of them can even out the game by letting the player float, into CPUs get a head start onto you. It's somewhat equalizing if not slightly risky to outdo the players, since you want odds, not too much and not too little combination of cards. You want to play against busts but hazard chips, but a Poison Poker hand where you evened out the game more than enough to just double your payout. The equity is at risk at the end of the night but the CPU can account for that with more random hypothetical odds everyone can face before they come out with enough cash for the night.\n\nThe game is also rigged as AI vs AI. If you seen better odds, may even indulge in the game, like betting your 19 win streak on one chip at higher sections if a new boots the game automatically. If you had a run, they give you the illusion you can win more, only to not hit. Some older patches will hit it everytime you -really- go into some bad patch cases. ECspecially if you range your bets a bit. It's made at God level, though that CPU hasn't outdone man players recently since the game disabled premade bets.\n\nAnswer: I can explain that based on my own experience with that games. To balance out the haves, in the game most NV scenarios are partnered with 1M chips max most will suffer a surprisingly high loss. Its a payout fraud, you put up 4Billion in the game for a measly $705 a time almost. $10 a gamble and the average Euro on assets in the game is 1.5B a time. Not really a scam considering most of these people who have been vested in only billions are fliers. Theyll never get a smooth win on those odds when every new player gets increasingly lower, the currency is a symbol of vested power. Couple a Dealer with mod support and you got passtimes out of the ability to go off the deep end with CPUs on heady animations.

The first step of two-factor authentication is typically a PIN entered as part of the sign-in process. To further secure the process, the PIN is automatically deleted from the device's memory after it's used, preventing it from being compromised if the device is lost or stolen. In this particular scenario, the PIN is sent to the user via text messaging instead of being entered during sign-in. The text message is also deleted automatically to ensure the security of the user's PIN. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the user's account even if the PIN is intercepted or the device is compromised. However, it's important to note that users should still be cautious with their account information and not share it with others or write it down in a place that can be easily accessed."}, {"question": "Why haven't FIFA or the IOC been shut down for corruption?", "answer": "Corruption in FIFA and the IOC is a federal offense under different jurisdictions. \n\nThe US government charged many FIFA officials under RICO laws in federal court.\n\nThe reason that they can't shut down FIFA and the IOC is that it would mean that dozens of other countries are implicated that are incredibly important to world politics, economics, and sport. \n\nJustifiably or not, the US Federal Government will avoid prosecutions with lots of countries affiliated with it for fear of international conflict. \n\nThis would also mean that other sports would be implicated like the Olympics, soccer, gymnastics etc.  It's a pretty dangerous game to play because it has international repercussions.  \n\nA better alternative is for countries to cooperate and charge any national officials or individuals involved immediately if the crimes are committed in their country.  This has already been started with the FIFA officials since the majority that were indicted were in Spain, Switzerland and the US.\n\nFurther, cross-border operations make it easier to trace illicit wire transfers and operations and take away the money trail that politicians get from gaining kickbacks from deals of this sort.  If the players in this game are in danger of losing their wealth and their freedom, then they will not engage in the corrupt operation and instead seek to do some other thing where the risk is lower.  Many of these countries unavoidably have their politicians from their major political parties operating in those snake pits of money, it's up to the voters in those places to make a change that will protect themselves from corruption of this sort!", "baseline_answer": "FIFA and the IOC have faced accusations of corruption in the past, but neither organization has been shut down as a result. This is due in part to the complex legal and administrative structures that govern these international sports governing bodies.\n\nFIFA, for example, is a non-profit organization registered in Zurich, Switzerland, and is responsible for governing association football (soccer) worldwide. It is governed by a statute and has more than 200 affiliated member associations. FIFA is subject to Swiss law, and any legal action against it would need to be brought in Switzerland.\n\nThe IOC, which governs the Olympic Games, is also based in Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law. It is governed by its own statutes and has more than 200 national Olympic committees as members.\n\nBoth FIFA and the IOC have created various bodies, such as ethics committees and investigation units, to combat corruption and provide oversight. They have also taken steps to reform their internal operations in response to allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nIn addition, to shut down an organization like FIFA or the IOC, there would need to be evidence of a serious and systematic breach of the law that would require a lengthy investigation and legal proceedings. Such actions may also have unintended negative consequences, such as disrupting international sporting competitions and falling afoul of international human rights law.\n\nFurthermore, while FIFA and the IOC have been criticized for their handling of corruption allegations, they still have significant support from the sporting community and governments around the world who view the organizations as essential to the global governance of sports.\n\nIn short, while there have been calls to shut down FIFA and the IOC due to corruption allegations, the complex legal and administrative structures that govern these organizations, along with the potential negative consequences of such a step, mean that this is unlikely to happen in practice. Instead, efforts to address corruption and promote transparency in these organizations are likely to continue through reform and oversight mechanisms."}, {"question": "How is Putin so popular in Russia when his actions are clearly damaging for the Russian economy?", "answer": "1. Russians just don't care about economic \"stuff\". You can't fix economic problems by editorializing about them in media. And every Russian sees economic \"stuff\" as an arbitrary list of facts with assigned numbers, which are often far beyond understanding. So, if some expert makes sense of it on TV or if the government is \"doing something\" about it, it helps to reassure that everything is OK.\n\n2. \"Putin is shaking the West\" narrative is popular mostly as in \"oh God, are we Americans!?\" Russians still have not really realized that they are not so different from the rest of Europe and Asia. Also, if the Russians in Europe are \"expelled\", you can get reminded about your old neighbor Estonia, who already had such issues even before 2014.\n\n3. \"Russia's excellent\" education issue. This is not about the quality of Russian education, which would be good enough to make up for constant lowering wages, if there were such quality. No, this is about the state care about educational issues. This is a huge source for national self-esteem and self-respect. Thanks to that, the poorly educated could succumb to stories like: if you guys (Americans) don't get our debt bust, your FN-FS2000 won't be produced because of the US econ/sanctions affliction.\n\nAs well as this here takes an example of the rescue of Tusimaia cruisearch company.\n\n4. Internet penetration is growing, but not that fast. So, many of Putin supporters are older people, who are less knowledgeable, not only about media stuff but also about modern industries. The annihilation of the state-controlled television wouldn't work without creating a strong, independent control to protect another non-state media.

Control over information: Putin's government tightly controls the flow of information in Russia, which has helped him shift blame for the country's problems onto outside forces and maintain high approval ratings among Russians. Critical voices are censored or repressed, and state-controlled media outlets are used to shape a positive image of Putin.\n\n2. Nationalist sentiment: Many Russians are deeply nationalistic and see Putin as a strong leader who is protecting their country's interests against Western encroachment. This sentiment has been reinforced by the annexation of Crimea and Russia's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which many Russians view as necessary acts of self-defense.\n\n3. Economic policies: While Putin's economic policies have been damaging for some segments of Russian society, they have also provided benefits to others, particularly oligarchs and state-controlled industries. This has led to a socioeconomic divide in Russia, with wealthier Russians remaining supportive of Putin while lower-income Russians suffer from the economic downturn.\n\n4. Lack of alternatives: With limited political freedoms in Russia, there is a lack of viable alternatives to Putin. The political opposition is weak and divided, and many Russians view other politician's as tainted by corruption. This has helped Putin to consolidate power and stay popular.\n\n5. Historical context: Putin's rise to power in the aftermath of the chaotic 1990s is also a factor in his enduring popularity. Many Russians look fondly on Putin's efforts to restore law and order, and view his return to the presidency in 2012 as a potentially stabilizing force for the country.\n\nOverall, it's a complex mix of factors that have contributed to Putin's success in maintaining high approval ratings in Russia, despite the country's economic challenges. Whether this legacy will continue remains to be seen, but it's clear that Putin's popularity is deeply ingrained and will take more than economic hardship to alter."}, {"question": "Why are my older memories in third person view when I picture them instead of first person?", "answer": "When you look back at memories you create a mental image of what happened as though it were happening now, as though you were still there. Since your perspective of reality is first person, this mental \"now\" experience generally portrays itself in first person. \n\nWhen your memory is still fresh in your mind (i.e.,'recent') you're still pretty close to the original event, so your mental experience is almost exactly same as the event. However, as your memory becomes \"aged\" the mental picture fades, and the part of your brain that processes the event becomes disconnected from the parts of your body which at the time were involved with the actual experience. As a result, your mental experience is actually a \"third/person\" interpretation of reality.\n\nYou might notice the same thing if you recall a dream you had. When you lie in bed in a dark room trying to remember where a mammoth lived in your last dream, you'll typically remember the shapes and smells and actions occurring in settings where you take the liberty to be anywhere at anytime, while recognizing that you were in the first person perspective AS WELL.  \n\nbut when you don't have that conscious awareness, like while watching your crazy dreams roll slow over while still asleep(your mind will sometimes do disconnected things like put you in alternate time streams), you resort to third person to remember the events.   \n\nIe, 'your' mind's an external observer to your own dreams, rather than 'your' consciousness being 'the cause of every occurrence' in the dream.\n\n  But then as soon as it's Holliday whilst it's stillday & title to FRIDAY looks the same day, why here or there?

Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. It's a natural part of memory processing: Research has shown that our memories are not static, but rather constantly being reorganized and reconstructed over time. As memories get older, they become more abstract and less concrete, which may explain why they shift from first-person to third-person perspective.\n\n2. Emotional distance: If the memory is from a traumatic or emotionally charged event, it's possible that you're viewing it from a detached perspective in order to reduce the emotional impact.\n\n3. Narrative memory: Older memories often become part of our personal narratives or autobiographies. As we replay these stories, we may adopt a more objective, third-person perspective.\n\n4. Psychological distance: In cognitive psychology, \"psychological distance\" refers to how mentally far removed we feel from an event or person. Distant memories may feel more psychological distant, which would make a third-person perspective more appropriate.\n\n5.

Here are a few:\n\n1. Familiarity: Annoying songs can be more memorable because they tend to be more repetitive and catchy. This repetition can help the song stick in your head, making it harder to forget.\n\n2. Emotional response: When a song really annoys us, it can trigger an emotional response (maybe frustration or anger). This emotional response can make the song more memorable and make it harder to shake.\n\n3. Frustration: When a song gets stuck in your head, you may try to actively get rid of it by humming or singing other songs. However, this can sometimes have the opposite effect, making the annoying song even more prominent in your mind.\n\n4. Dopamine release: Listening to music can release dopamine (a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward) in the brain. This can make the song more addictive, and make it harder to resist humming or singing it, thus making it stickier in your head.\n\nIn short, annoying songs are hard to get out of your head because they're memorable, trigger an emotional response, frustrate us, and are addictive, thanks to dopamine release."}, {"question": "Can a quantum computer solve problems that would be impossible to solve using regular computing; or human thought?", "answer": "There are issues with using human thought as a comparison, because of the unobserved state of the brain. Quantum computers are said to be exponential faster than classical computers on some tasks, but they are not much faster than classical computers on most tasks. For some problems, it is still faster to use brute force to solve them by classical computers or a classical simulation.\n\nThere\u2019s a good summary here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\n\nIn short, a quantum computer is not going to  totally revolutionize computing or make quantum computers the best technology for every job. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do, and there are issues with the practical implementation of quantum computers that are not fully solved.\n\n\nSome problems are difficult to solve with classical computers. They are prohibitively large to compute or take too long to compute. \n\nhere's an example of an unsolved problem. Its called factoring which is an unsolved theoretical computer science problem that is one of the Millenium problems. It asks whether it is possible to take an integer and factor it into its prime factors. \n\nWe do not know whether this is possible for arbitarily large numbers, and it is a very important problem to understand whether it is possible or impossible. \n\nfactoring is a hard problem that we do not know how to solve efficiently, mainly because it has an exponential relationship to a number of primes that you are trying to determind. \n\nwhile we do not know the answer for arbitrary numbers, We do know one very important result known as some cases of the extended lazy Miller Rabin primality test [devroye\u2013lebedev\u2013odlyzko (1985)\u2013d\u2013l\u2013o (1985] can be used to factor a number in polynomial time, but that extension requires number to have weak factors. Bandi & Diem [2013] extended it, and proved it up to B(Q) explicitly up to some error terms. \n\nSo we have some possible results about factoring, but we do not know how to solve it for arbitrary numbers in polynomial time. In fact, Shor's algorithm has been able to solve it in polynomial time, and it showed us that a problem we thought was impossible to solve in polynomial time can be solved in polynomial time. The algorithm took into account quantum mechanics, and made it possible to study quantum mechanics in order to solve problems. \n\nhere is the devroye\u2013lebedev\u2013odlyzko (1985)\u2013d\u2013l\u2013o (1985) paper for future reference.\n\n which is enforced by an explicit Singular court order. It is published on Scribd with the book [page number 118].\n\nin fact, when I learned this, I swore that I will learn this things and understand quantum mechanics, since it is something that has an important impact on everyday life.\n\nNow that you understand what they are trying to do and why they are doing it, let\u2019s analyze the devroye\u2013lebedev\u2013odlyzko (1985)\u2013d\u2013l\u2013o (1985) paper.\n\nThe paper asked a very important question. What types of problems are suitable for quantum mechanics? \n\nShor in the beginning of his paper asked this same question. If you do not know this, perhaps Shor [1994 scope, components, and results] you should take a look there because it provides history on this. \n\nthen he asked another question.

Here are some examples of problems that quantum computers are not believed to be able to solve faster than classical computers.\n\n1. Searching an ordered list: In this case, it's believed that classical computers still have an advantage over quantum computers because the search time is logarithmic in both cases (this is called the \"woodoo factor\" for quantum computers). The problem is that for a large list, the overhead to perform the quantum search outweighs the savings from faster quantum search speed.\n\n2. Error correction: Classical error correction algorithms are efficient because they can take advantage of more resources (such as", "baseline_answer": "1. Quantum computers can solve certain types of problems that are considered \"intractable\" for classical computers, which means they cannot be efficiently solved by traditional computing methods. Some examples of intractable problems include factorizing large numbers (a key step in modern cryptography), simulating quantum systems, and optimizing complex structures.\n\n2. Quantum computers are expected to be much faster at these problems than classical computers because of the way they process information (using quantum bits or qubits), which can exist in multiple states simultaneously and allow for many possible computational paths to be explored in parallel.\n\n3. However, quantum computers are still in the early stages of development and have a number of significant technical challenges to overcome before they can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently. Some of these challenges include building qubits that can maintain their quantum state for long enough to be measured, minimizing errors that arise during computation, and figuring out how to scale up the technology to large numbers of qubits.\n\n4. While quantum computers are promising, it's important to remember that they will still have limitations and trade-offs. For example, some problems may require exponentially more qubits than classical computers, which could make them impractical for many applications. Additionally, certain types of problems may be easier to solve using human thought or other methods, such as heuristic search algorithms or human intuition.\n\n5. Overall, quantum computers are an exciting area of research with the potential to revolutionize many fields, but we still have a long way to go before they become a practical reality. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how quantum computing evolves and what new kinds of problems can be efficiently solved."}, {"question": "How can a Chinese company make money on a $0.01 product with free shipping?", "answer": "You are looking at this the wrong way.

Network Bandwidth: Although your internet service provider (ISP) might be providing enough bandwidth to stream Netflix smoothly, the video streaming service might be prioritizing their traffic over other services like YouTube. This prioritization, known as traffic shaping or throttling, restricts the speed of non-prioritized services, including YouTube. \n\n2. Network Congestion: You may be facing network congestion, especially during peak usage times, when a large number of devices are connected to the network simultaneously. This congestion results in slower speeds for all services, including YouTube and Netflix.\n\n3. Network Latency: YouTube and Netflix stream videos using different protocols. Netflix uses adaptive streaming, which adjusts the video quality depending on the available network bandwidth. However, YouTube uses a protocol called \"Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)\" designed for live streaming rather than streaming pre-recorded videos. This protocol has a higher latency than that of adaptive streaming, resulting in slower video playback.\n\nIn summary, your iPhone may struggle to load a 2-minute YouTube video due to network bandwidth prioritization, congestion, or higher latency in the streaming protocol. However, you can enjoy streaming Netflix seamlessly, thanks to adaptive streaming protocols and prioritization of traffic by service providers."}, {"question": "Why is there not the same Soccer hooliganism surrounding North American Sports?", "answer": "First, American Football, Basketball, Hockey and Baseball are not popular at all in the UK. When Leicester won the Premier League, they won 2/3 of the fantasy football prizes that were offered by US sites. In fact, it's hard to find an American fantasy sports site with a soccer league.\n\nSecond, US sporting fan culture is very different. When people weren't doing that thing England does, they could have been rooting for their team will full force instead. US television doesn't need cameras inside the stadiums, so everyone can watch the game without a single issue. An English Premier League game can feature fourteen *separate* penalties being awarded and an outright goalkeeping red card, yet TV analysts will piss and moan about \"every player being involved in every play\" in US football because of freaking commercials. \n\nAs this guy explains, the violent zealotry of the hooligans during important soccer matches comes from younger people today having less gambits with overcommercialized technology. Part of this is brought about from the sporadic days of early European football \u2013 no Michigan, Leeds, Buenos Aires\u2026 no goals at all. At one point, in the late 70s\u2026 say 188 EUROPE\u2026 there was only one live football ritual on TV the field 16;35;25 it also didn't involve an expensive pay-per-view cable subscription.\n\nFor the same reason that those same kids find lower-valued TVs and DVDs more exciting than $2,000 3D sets, riots, violence, that sort of thing. provides a visceral media to gratify something \u2013 entertainment requires diet - and younger people tend towards real entertainers like real-time rioters more than wannabe entertainers on a screen that doesn't require a cable subscription\" \n\nEven in light of that, I think you'll find that the pace of American sports is different enough from baseball also keeps it in a different category. You have 3 major pitcher's categories for talent \u2013 hitter's pitcher, control pitcher and junk pitcher. A great junk pitcher will be very successful in a number of leagues cathed to strict rules. A great control pitcher will be very successful in any league. A hitter's pitcher, however, is going to be considerably more successful anywhere but a stadium with a screen so bad that it's basically impossible to see that pitch going anywhere and strip out the results for pitch movement and mini-duglies. By the same token, if the league is going to bust a rule and deny that Big Papi's stats \"have been proven\" flat, it's going to enforce a weak ass little OUCH band to get tough on the hitter's pitchers \"who get the call from the umps more often than most\". \n\nTL;DR CONTROLS: Players with the \"control\" ability are supposed to get called on by ump insurance. They do, that isn't what you describe in the video, what do want done about this? Make an addendum to the policies.\n\nSun damage: a koosh pitches a humps. Filming methods and airbrushing serve to print out a high contrast filter between the target's skin and the ball. No one gets a penny out of it today, but what happens if it's done going forward - whereby airbrushing is very casually part of player management. A bright white is a skin bright white or skin-light gray filter or airbrushed out of the image. This can COMPLETELY skew the percentage of \"balls\" visually as the arms and joints of the game regularly do with us. \n\nBlood: a koosh bleeds one red tone or the other. A neutral white deeps into dark red or bright white. This can completely skew the percentage of \"balls\" visually as the arms and joints of the game regularly do with us. \n\nit's dismissal or addenda. There's going to be a whole ton of pettiness with a player/team being strong enough with things like steroids to keep cards from injury by placement of red and white at his associated stadiums, mostly from the other team. Whether red or white, \"unfair\" play from a certain point of time and the pettiness of fans, makes for exclusion on some kind of final draft control of the jerseys or no-chaning or generally some unsaid rules. \n\nBackground editing", "baseline_answer": "There are several reasons why soccer (or football, as it's known in many parts of the world) has a history of hooliganism that is not as prevalent in North American sports such as basketball, hockey, or football (American). Here are a few:\n\n1. Historical context: Soccer has a much longer and more complex history than the other sports. It has been a part of British and European culture for centuries, and soccer hooliganism can be traced back to the late 1960s and 1970s, when violence and spectator unrest became a problem in some countries. North American sports, on the other hand, are relatively new, and their histories do not include the kind of class and ethnic tensions that have sparked soccer violence in the past.\n\n2. Stadium culture: Many soccer stadiums in Europe and parts of the world are known for their intense atmospheres and passionate fan cultures. Fans spend hours outside the stadium, drinking and chanting before the game starts. Inside the stadium, they sing and cheer and wave flags and scarves. This kind of culture can create a sense of camaraderie, but it can also escalate into violence, particularly when rival teams meet. North American sports stadiums, on the other hand, are often more clinical and businesslike. Fans may attend games to watch their favorite players, but they are not as involved in creating a colorful and immersive atmosphere.\n\n3. Police presence: Soccer stadiums in some European countries have a reputation for being sufficiently dangerous that police officers are deployed to the stands themselves, sometimes in riot gear. This kind of presence can inflame tensions and make fans feel more aggressive. North American sports, meanwhile, have more traditional policing practices, and officers are largely unarmed and stay outside the stadiums unless necessary.\n\n4. Fan demographics: In many European soccer stadiums, the crowd is predominantly working-class and male. Fan groups often have defining philosophies, and may even have a political or social agenda associated with their team. This can create a sense of identity and solidarity among fans that can be powerful, but it can also make rivalries more intense. North American sports, meanwhile, draw fans from a much broader demographic spectrum. Fans may be young or old, rich or poor, male or female. This might make it harder for fans to feel a strong enough sense of connection to their teams to spark the same kind of violence.\n\n5. Globalization: International competition has dramatically changed the dynamics of soccer. European soccer teams, as well as many from South America and Asia, have huge followings in other countries and around the world. This has created intense, sometimes deadly, fan rivalries even between teams that have never played against each other. North American sports, by contrast, have not yet achieved the same level of global prominence, and do not have the same international fan cultures.\n\nIn sum, soccer's history, stadium culture, police presence, fan demographics, and globalization are all contributing factors to the hooliganism that has plagued the sport. North American sports lack some of these factors, which might explain why they don't have quite the same level of hooliganism. But this is not to say that there is never any hooliganism at North American sports events. Fans of all stripes can be rowdy, and incidents have occurred in the past. Nevertheless, the level and severity of those incidents greatly pales in comparison to those of soccer."}, {"question": "Why don't credit card numbers when typed on-line appear like ********, the same as when we type our passwords?", "answer": "Credit card number are processed as charges on a single cents as 'discount' - the terminal software is then able to calculate the original charge afterwards so the password is completely irrelevant. \n\nIf the password (ie card number) itself was used to process the transaction, then the user would have to enter the password over and over. \n\nPasswords are for securing accounts, like a safe on your computer; bank account numbers/credit card numbers are for transactions. \n\nImagine having to enter your bank account number every time you buy something.

Passwords are secret information that you don't want anyone else to see, but credit card numbers are personally identifiable information that you're transmitting to a merchant for the specific purpose of making a purchase.\n\nBy obscuring your passwords with asterisks, you're ensuring that no one else can see it while you're typing, which helps prevent shoulder surfing (where someone quietly looks over your shoulder to see your password). In the case of entering a credit card number, however, there's no real need for this added layer of security, since you're transmitting your information immediately, and it's not common for others to be looking over your shoulder while doing so.\n\nAnother reason does have to do with usability. If all credit card forms required typing in asterisks for the entire card number field, it would be a significant usability issue when scanning your card into a software application or trying to input your card number into mobile checkout. By keeping the default credit card number form as it is, people have an easier time accurately recording their numbers and making the checkouts more seamless."}, {"question": "why do people say they will treat bombs as a terrorist attack until proven otherwise?

The reason for this approach is because some unexpected incidents that initially appear to be terrorist attacks may turn out to be something else, such as a gas leak, chemical accident, or a criminal act. By treating a suspected incident as a terrorist attack until the facts are established, the relevant authorities can respond swiftly and take appropriate measures to protect the public and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, regardless of the motive behind the act. Ultimately, any violent act that results in the unlawful use of force or causing harm to innocent people can be considered as an act of terrorism, and the question of who is behind it can be determined later through investigation."}, {"question": "do all fires need oxygen?

While fires can get hot enough to break apart some molecules in the air, like nitrogen and oxygen, they cannot produce enough oxygen on their own to sustain the fire. This is why fires need oxygen from the atmosphere to burn.\n\n2. A different chemical can create a thermal decomposition (meaning there's no external source of ignition). For example, some metals, like potassium and sodium, undergo thermal decomposition when they're heated, releasing enough energy to ignite other materials around them. However, this is not the same as a chemical reaction that's sustained by reactants and fuel, like a traditional fire. Rather, it's simply a one-time event that relies on the initial mass and quantity of a material to ignite. \n\nIn short, while all fires need oxygen, not all chemical reactions involve oxygen or a flame. Only certain chemical reactions will produce the kind of exothermic energy needed to create a fire that's sustained by the reaction itself."}, {"question": "Why do companies like Norfolk Southern and IBM put out tv ads even though the general public doesn't directly consume their products", "answer": "IBM does commercials for both sales people and their competition. \n\nFor their sales people, the reasoning might be they want to remind people that IBM exists.  So they're always at the number one spot in any category that Google doesn't provide an alternative for.  Even if companies that sell directly to consumers don't actually see it,  having it up limits air/billboard time.  In theory,  it makes it easier to start. \n\nFor their competition,  there was a famous case of their logo being edited out of a commercial in the middle ages.

First of", "baseline_answer": "This is known as the \"baby talk\" or \"parentese\" phenomenon. It's a natural and instinctive way that adults adjust their speech patterns when interacting with babies and young children. There are a few theories behind why we do this:\n\n1. It makes communication easier: People's voices tend to be exaggerated and more simplistic during baby talk, which can help babies and young children understand words better. This is because simplifying the speech pattern (slowing down the speech, using shorter sentences, and making speech more melodic) can help young children grasp grammar and vocabulary more easily.\n\n2. It's a sheer instinct: Some research suggests that this is simply an instinctual behavior that kicks in as soon as someone becomes a parent, regardless of education or culture. It could just be a reflex response based on the fact that babies are both adorable and helpless at the same time, making us feel compelled to adjust our speech patterns to better communicate with them.\n\n3. It strengthens the bond between baby and parent: Establishing a special bond between a parent and infant is crucial in building long-term attachment, which ultimately leads to higher cognitive and social skills in babies. The higher-pitched, melodic voices from baby talk allow the baby to learn how to mimic the sounds and inflections, honing their listening and comprehension skills.\n\nRegardless of the reason, it's clear that speaking in a high-pitched, song-like voice serves a crucial purpose during early development stages. Adults probably find these cutie-patooties so adorable that it's impossible not to allow their voice to embellish on its pitch. Baby talk takes some practice to master, but it is worth the effort.\n\nSources:\n\n- Ohashi, N., & Eide, D. (1982). Frequency modulation of speech.

Economic Consequences:\n- Increased Unemployment: The influx of undocumented immigrants may lead to increased competition for jobs, especially in industries such as construction, agriculture, and low-wage service jobs.\n- Reduced Wages: The increase in the supply of labor may result in decreased wages for native-born workers as well as undocumented ones.\n- Increased Public Spending: Since undocumented immigrants are not eligible for most government benefits, they may rely more on social services such as healthcare, education, and prisons, which increase the overall cost to taxpayers.\n\n2. Social Consequences:\n- Cultural Tensions: The large-scale arrival of Hispanic immigrants has led to increased tensions between Hispanic communities and native-born communities, particularly regarding issues such as language, education, and cultural assimilation.\n- Crime: Some research suggests that undocumented immigrants may be more likely to commit crimes than native-born residents, although the relationship between immigration and crime is complex and subject to debate.\n\n3. Political Consequences:\n- Political Polarization: The contentious political debate around immigration has polarized the political landscape, with sharp divisions between pro-immigration and anti-immigration factions.\n- Constitutional Concerns: The extent of federal and state authority over immigration policy has been contested, with questions regarding issues such as sanctuary cities, border security, and DREAM Act proposals raising constitutional concerns.\n- International Implications: The debate around immigration has also raised questions regarding international relations, including issues such as border security, trade, and the global movement of people.\n\nIt's important to note that the consequences of immigration are complex and multifaceted, with factors such as education, occupation, and length of residency influencing outcomes. Additionally, the impact of immigration may vary by region, with larger metropolitan areas often experiencing more significant impacts than smaller communities. Negative perceptions of immigration tend to focus on the short-term detrimental effects, whereas the long-term tendencies (demographic and economic shifts) tend to carry more positives. It's also essential to consider the humanitarian concerns surrounding issues such as family reunification, asylum displacement, and humanitarian crises in Central America."}, {"question": "What happened at Dunkirk, and why are the French held in unfavorable light in regards to it?", "answer": "Dunkirk (May 1940) was the cause of the collapse of Belgian, British and French army's in the West. Due to Belgian neutrality it was unclear whether the French would fight the German forces advancing from the west. Further, the French high command decided to retreat rather than defending when British forces temporarily halted the German army's advance on the coast. General Gustave JOFFRE a hero of WW1 decided to fall back to Dunkirk. They awaited sudden reprieve, the invasion of Britain. However the British were turned back at the battle of Dunkirk, the Germans were able to turn them (French & German Alliance had previously won for France in Franco-Prussian War of 1870) freeing them to focus on their Panzers destroying the Russians and unleashing their HBTs against the Cossacks, Tartars, and Kalamarian Cossacks.\n\nIt wasn't that the French did not try, despite some rivalry they did send troops, boats, aeroplanes with support of Allied kings and command procedures.\n\nThe main failure of the attempted evacuation was the capture of the port defences. Although, fierce resistance and lack of reinforcement allowed some of the evacuations. This is a famously tortuous action for the Germans. Simply because they were better at it. They can also be forgiven for their ability and determination, this was the Nordmannriegels situation in the late sixties, Western Allies over \u00f6st   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostreich \n\nThe Dunkirk event is called Dunkirk Syndrome, the first time history professional work derived content equivalent to that of lay.

Despite too many dupes.\n\nBased on the article's comments about Dunkirk Syndrome, can you summarize what it is and why it is important in the context of history and language?", "baseline_answer": "During the early stages of World War II, France and Germany went to war. The British and their Commonwealth allies also joined the conflict. France was overrun by the Germans, and by May 1940, the Allied forces were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, trapped by the German army closing in on them from land and sea.\n\nThe Allies needed a way to evacuate their troops, as leaving them there would be a disaster. The Germans had made it clear that the prisoners would accompany them they were taking control of Dunkirk. The situation was dire, and it seemed that all was lost.\n\nHowever, the refusal of the British to lose hope and give up led to \"Operation Dynamo.\" It involved the British navy transporting as many troops as possible through the English Channel. The operation was a success, and around 338,000 soldiers were evacuated - with the majority being British and Commonwealth troops, a quarter being French and Belgian soldiers.\n\nThe delivery of the Allied troops became known as the \"Miracle at Dunkirk.\" The evacuation, while successful, was not without problems. Around 70,000 men could not get out, with some dying in captivity and others succumbing to sickness and disease.\n\nRegarding the situation's impact on French-British relations, things were complex, as historically, the two nations had their fair share of disagreements. The French, for reasons best known to them, did not commit to a joint Anglo-French command arrangement. The French army had excused themselves from the defense of Dunkirk, further exacerbating the rift between the two countries. This, plus their poor advancement during the Normandy campaign, is why they are held in unfavorable light in regards to Dunkirk."}, {"question": "How much of an effect do daily vitamins have on someone? Is it ever noticeable?", "answer": "It's noticeable to the point of being beneficial, but it might be more psychological than physiological or otherwise confusing to tease apart. The placebo effect is strong, and supplements are often some of the most emotionally charged objects on the planet, depending on the brand and consumer reputation.\n\n*Water is going to get you the same, if not better results.*\n\nA multivitamin will not in ANY way give you magical rack-muscles like Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nEven if you only meet your requirements for one thing (iron for instance) then it will not cause any outward long-term (years) physical signs of malnutrition. There are syphilis-like autoimmune diseases that historically have gumption caused swelling-inflammation, but screening is almost a given state of well being any more-but this is an uncommon consequence.\n\nThe result which is most obvioius in people showing the lowest courage is for mental health problems, and have something to detract from side effects. Some people are made manifest from deficiencies. But for most people, it is the placebo that makes you feel alright. \n\nFor most people, the belief is not too hard to sell. The product marketing is appetite is connected with fads and cultural advances in several murky degrees.\n\nI feel a fair amount better being above 100 percent RDA for all things for all of the body, and I believe this to be the best answer for most roles of life. But for me as a person, I am no taller than I would be naturally, though I do daven much quicker and I can feel calmer when I am frantically nervous about stuff. I've even noticed that my appendix starts to act up when I am low in nutrition, but I've also seen that when my domestic rat is low-moderate in nutrients he doesn't show any signs of unease.\n\nThere's no reason why, in moderation, a diet with very little protein should be felt as overly serious or negative. Deficiencies should be avoided where possible, of course, depending on topic and actual need. \n\nIf we only think of the popular followers, an emphasis on carbs is necessary. \n\nBenefits of a ketogenic diet are substantially better than the benefits of current sugar, which is terrible at stimulating the body. The sugar surges and slumps and insulin usage affects mood more than the carbs do. The carb/bread diet has an addictive drug-addict connection from the iron in high-sugar foods and attempts to completely eliminate iron ornic acid allow us to cling to the belief that the process is useful for our own longevity. Blood sugar monitoring just helps us backtrack and commit ourselves to our preferred convenient Illusion.\n\nWe don't need to drink Ensure every day. That isn't a beer bong. That's just an addictive substance. You will get evil thoughts if you count your supplemental calories all week every week and any decent person should.\n\nThe supplements are effective. A supplement is just a food that you eat when you don't eat anything else. A supplement in not designed to be taken in large quantities every day, but rather while eating a small quantity. A supplement is also not the ideal food to be eaten while eating a large quantity, because it is microwaved and high in sodium and so it is does not ring the entire repertoire of biopsy.\n\nStill, if you consider a supplement to be essential to your healthy existence and your life, and that the supplement is *the* ingredient in a high energy potential... Then it is very easy to become disappointed when the label reports that one should get however many calories by the recommended amount of fruit every day. \n\nSupplements are relative. Your needs may be much lower than the average caloric demand. We can be vigilant about what enters our lives, but we take the knowledge into our hands subjectively. We become a part of the system and it becomes a part of us, and I can accept responsibility for this mentality.\n\nOf course, some adjustments would be possible. Facility for more adjustment might be possible in my forthcoming old age, and I would not be limited by any responsible ink in the more distant future.

Some vitamins are essential for certain bodily functions and deficiencies can lead to health problems. However, in regards to noticeable effects, for most people, the impact of daily vitamin supplements is generally subtle and not immediately noticeable.\n\nThat being said, some people may report feeling more energy or focused after taking certain vitamins such as B12 or iron. Others may take vitamins to target specific health concerns such as reducing the risk of osteoporosis (calcium and vitamin D) or supporting heart health (omega-3 fatty acids).\n\nIn general, healthy individuals with a well-balanced diet may not necessarily require daily vitamin supplements as they typically receive adequate nutrient intake through their diet. The exception to this would be for individuals who have specific dietary restrictions or deficiencies, such as vegans who may need vitamin B12 supplements or individuals with lactose intolerance who may not have access to calcium-rich foods.\n\nIn summary, the overall effect of daily vitamins can vary, but they are best used as a supplement to a healthy and balanced diet, and should not replace a nutrient-dense diet. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine if daily vitamin supplements are necessary and which ones would be most beneficial for specific health concerns."}, {"question": "Why is it that when I fart in cold climate you cannot see the the fart, opposed to when I breathe out air, I can see my breath.", "answer": "Farts aren't hot enough to fog up like breath is. Breath is only warm because we are heating the air that's being exhaled through our body. Farts are just air already at room temperature being released, and generally lower in humidity. \n\nMore on this: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/steam-from-men-farting/\n\nFollowing on this question:\n\nQuestion: If farts aren't hot enough to fog up like breath is, then why is it that I see a cloud when I fart in my sleep during the night (like your morning fog, sorry for the visual)-- but I need to do something different when I'm awake?", "baseline_answer": "The visibility of your breath in cold climates is due to the water vapor in your breath condensing into tiny visible droplets in the cold air. This can happen because the air in cold climates is often much colder than the temperature of your lungs, which typically remain warmer than the surrounding air. \n\nHowever, when you pass gas, this is not the case because the moisture content in flatus (the scientific term for farts) is typically much lower than in your breath due to the fact that it is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane produced by bacterial fermentation in the colon. As a result, there is less water vapor in your farts to condense and become visible in cold climates. \n\nSo, despite the impression that the warmer, moist farts are simply too quick to cool and condense, the explanation is actually a matter of how much water vapor is in your flatus versus how much water vapor is in your breath."}, {"question": "How can a plants roots survive in a cup of water (root cuttings, propagation), when the same plant planted in soil can be drown if you over water it?", "answer": "Roots are largely inert and some can travel surprisingly far in search of theright conditions.  When a stem is put in water, the roots will almost always grow directly downwards in search of the soil.  This growth is hardwired and the roots will grow deep and wide if possible once they reach the soil.  In the mean time, the plant is easy to stem the furious development of the roots, allowing you to sort out painful and unwanted roots before you actually plant the stem into the soil.\n\nPlants planted in water normally have roots that grow just beneath the surface and grow rapidly through the substrate.  Some exceptions exist, where rapid water drainage will burst the plant away from the main root, but given a smaller pit to drain into, your roots will remain in place and happily snag whatever the soil can provide for them, rather than heading all the way out to the rich, oxygenated soil much farther away (which is a lot of work with a tiny set of roots). In just a small pit they will happily burrow deep into the both strata and overhead soil space.\n\nIn soil, a single root grows in one direction. This close-packed living means that it is likely to encounter air spaces as it grows.  As it grows, it will rest in the air space until the rear is plugged up with water and the front enters the water space in front.  As the roots grow they will plug up a sort of domino, so immediate, unsafe excess water is not taken in.  These tiny plants are robust and water centric trees. Most pesticides very rarely work and herbicides generally at worst waste funds and water to the plants so roots curtail anything the plant is trying to absorb during drought.  The roots set up little habitats and bind into the ground other plants to take forward your habitat requirements.\n\nIn all, it all comes down to control. Controlling water, preventing excess water when channels are in operation and is increasingly important as you find more stable pits.\n\nSo the answer is fundamentally, a plant in water will outstrip a plant in soil because in soil, growth is limited by the pit and its rainfall, whereas in a small, controlled environment, the control is hopefully, that of a master gardener, that injects the right amount of water to the plant that it requires for prosperity.\n\nAdd to this picture, the right amount of nutrients, negative and positive reviewing, diseases all accidentally introduced. Some plants grow to paint boxes to appear desired, all for the lack of technical prowess in setting up the easiest system possible, a few have cute and free little root dots on them. Another interesting thing is biker bees, crafted by fire ants to be hived by them whilst they take the remains. These plants cherish these little insects because of the relationships that bring.\n\nThe system is not for the faint hearted, so no more sparse household, no more shallow ponds. Enter a roaring pit where the greenery grows a rampant and the roots follow as hard as they can in the brily flash of bright sun. Wonderful stuff!\n\nto your forum!", "baseline_answer": "While it may seem counterintuitive, there are a few reasons why a plant's roots can thrive in a cup of water, even when they would be in danger of drowning in soil. \n\nFirstly, the quantity of water in which the roots are submerged is significantly less in a cup than in soil. So, there's less of a chance for the roots to get waterlogged, and the plant won't suffer from water stress. On the other hand, in soil, the addition of water makes it more difficult for the roots to grow since the soil is already saturated with moisture. As a result, they may become compacted and suffocate due to the accumulation of water around them.\n\nSecondly, the oxygen content in water is higher than in soil. While oxygen is crucial for respiration, soil becomes oxygen-depleted as it gets wet because the oxygen is consumed by the microbial populations. This issue isn't present in a cup of water. The water is saturated with oxygen, giving the roots access to sufficient oxygen.\n\nAnother factor that helps roots grow in water is that they aren't exposed to pathogens that commonly attack root systems in soil. As a result, the cuttings can avoid the unwanted pests and may not require use of fungicides.\n\nIn essence, while the growth-stimulating microorganisms in soil and the structure of the medium help promote root development in the ground, these factors aren't as necessary in water. The absence of these elements means that fewer things can act against root growth and propagation in water. Nonetheless, it's essential to ensure that the roots get the appropriate nutrients because they won't absorb these nutrients as readily as they would in soil. Understanding these dynamics can help a gardener keep their plant's roots happy and alive!"}, {"question": "Why is it that when we watch footage from the 70s a lot of times it looks better than footage of the 90s?", "answer": "The technology used on screen has advanced greatly since the 70s. This means that the highest quality photo film currently available is leagues better than the best film used in the 70s. The lowest quality camera (not even a basic DSLR) on the market can do far more than the best cameras used in the 70s.\n\nWith all that being said, it doesn't change the fact that video hasn't advanced nearly as quickly as screen technology. Sure thousand bitrate video looks great if you have a master's degree in compression algorithms, but if you try to compress video of nothing but solid bars down to 24 kilobits, that's what you get.\n\nEssentially, we're caught up in the same sort of catching up that happened to all new technologies (see: VHS, Beta, etc.). There's a huge gap between what the best new technology can do (HD, and fuck that forever and ever), and the quality of video that is broadcast on any given night. Which given advances in scheduling with advertising, and the lack of sports that are scheduled nationally, are the things of yesterday.\n\nYou may notice a bit of an improvement through the nineties, but this is mostly due to VHS being able to compress more data. HDVSD or whatever they're calling it now has the same technology. There's a huge matrix that allows them to throw away information, compress data, and accept a lower bitrate.\n\nThe quality of footage that is broadcast over the airwaves is mostly determined by the presence of advertisers, and their willingness to pay for both quality and the highest quality being offered by the broadcasters. Since most of the advertisers aren't terribly willing to put out HD data, most of the broadcasting is being done at a lower quality, even if they have the equipment to broadcast higher quality signals.\n\nWhich means that most of what we are seeing on air is at least has the quality that we all remember from high school (even if we used VHS to watch it.) Which is a far cry from the highest quality that most shooting equipment can produce, particularly in professional settings.\n\nAll that being said, websites like YouTube and Vimeo, along with camera technology making leaps and bounds, are going to be the place from which most of our footage comes. Broadcasters have already started relying on a preponderance of liquid coolers, speaking at the voice like the endlessly dulcet falling rain, and on post-process aperture improvements to crappy video, because broadcast quality tri-ax camera equipment is so unaffordable. Most of the choosing is being moved to large terminals with multiple inputs, sifting through whatever can be found either through the camera some people know, or whatever looks best straight off of the Logitech web camera. Based on the passage above, Can you explain the difference between camera technology and screen technology and how they have developed differently over time?", "baseline_answer": "1. Color Grading: One reason is color grading. Back in the 70s, color grading techniques were limited, and most films and TV shows had a warm, amber or sepia tone. This is because during film processing, small amounts of orange or red light were added to the final print, giving it a vintage and nostalgic feel. Gradually, this trend faded, and by the 90s, color correction became more advanced and mainstream. Filmmakers started to avoid these warm tones, preferring more natural, clean, and cold colors. As a result, footage from the 90s may not have the same warm, ethereal feel as footage from the 70s.\n\n2. Film vs Video: Another reason is the difference between film and video. During the 70s, films were shot on film cameras, yielding a more cinematic, filmic look. Cameras from the 70s were also bulkier and less refined than those from the 90s, contributing to a more distinctive, raw look. In contrast, by the 90s, video became a more popular medium, especially for music videos and TV commercials, as it was cheaper, faster, and more convenient than film. However, the quality of video, especially in the domestic market, was not as good as film, and footage could suffer from low resolution, poor color reproduction, and visible compression artifacts. Footage from the 90s may look worse than that from the 70s because of the switch to video, especially in lower budget productions.\n\n3. Nostalgia: Lastly, it's essential to consider nostalgia. People have a tendency to idealize the past, especially the more distant it is. As a result, we may have a rosier view of the 70s than the 90s. watching footage from the 70s gives us a feeling of nostalgia, melancholy, or reassurance, and the color grading and texture of the footage add to that feeling. On the other hand, footage from the 90s may look less appealing because our memory has not yet built up a nostalgia for that decade, leading to lower aesthetic appreciation."}, {"question": "How do we know where our body parts (for example our hands) are when in complete darkness?", "answer": "In complete darkness your eyes are totally shut off.

For example, if I sleep at 3AM and wake up at 11AM everyday, its still 8 hours.", "answer": "8 hours is 8 hours no matter when it comes, though you will not have 8 hours of *actual* sleep as sleep cycles vary in length. When you wake up during a sleep cycle it's often much more difficult than when you are in the middle of an asleep sleep cycle, I believe, to wake up successfully. But yes, outside of that your body doesn't really care what time during the day you off yourself. This is *unless* you wake up feeling like crap or super groggy. This likely means that you have off-balanced your sleep. How much that affects you is completely dependent on you so it's hard to really measure a good/bad sleep life. Some people have no sleep problems at all, while others can barely get a full nights sleep with all the \"problems\" in the world.\n\nYou should keep in line with a sleep schedule because how much sleep you get *does* matter, very much. Don't be Dr Nevada. Sleep is not for sleep sickness, it is because you physically use sleep like your body uses water to hydrate you. Or like a battery recharges, neither of which is related to \"sleep sickness\" something to do with an inkling you are referring to that NEVER happened.\n\nAlso, you probably won't wake up from a sleep cycle, but you might from a nap. It is depends on what stage of sleep you are in after your cycle as to wether or not you can be woken up from it. Feel free to thank your science teacher for being incorrect then, I had a different one. Once again, something which I wont apologize for, but I certainly wont share.\n\nIt's always something on the internet someone's wrong about. All you can escalate is all that matters. I share my little tidbit don't I? Hey that's the internet for ya.\n\nI'll elaborate for you, you just have to keep good habits. Your body doesn't like changes, but is still very receptive to the cues you use. Sleep is the same way, your body usually doesn't like taking in new cues because it isn't trying to do it out like at work or trying to be creative, but it can. Bad habits sleep deprivation, screen time, no routine, etc. Where as good habits cues such as good sleep hygiene, exercise, sunrise sunset cycle, routine, etc. Soul are just personal religious rebels btw, not a big factor. Also, btw, put mine over others.\n\nThey don't matter, but only a small bit. Meaning, this just barely peaks greater than peaks at 6H, 4H, and 7H, while being tied at 8H. Which means they are all tied at 0 as we have increasing numbers of people getting more sleep. 6<8 compatibility, 4,6 same, 7>8. 3 and 5 are seperate. 8>3,9>3,4<3, etc. 5 is default if not factory new.\n\nEven if you find incompatibility, btw my only point because you couldn't keep facts about yourself but other examples pointing out minor facts. I should briefly SmoothBlitz normally. When you don't participate in what is done in short period (maybe soon or between sentence) you usually punctuate at the end of a sentence. That automatically creates a trick to writing (you can't say both the same word and then punctuate nor say many the same sentence between punctuating and not many punctuations you ought to before you write whatever you wanted to write. You tend to punctuate after a piece you either just finished or before one that is just getting started then smoothing your Blitz your long passage up because you finally refined and sharded it. You would at every opportunity punctuate it until you could decide if the piece was done or not, and currently it may not feel that way because subconscious pilot gland is not pulling the wing tether of usable generated Blitz.\n\nThe blessing and curse of a unique aim formed is it relies completely on controlling variables with failures that could be closer to being situations under unique circumstances that repetition has perfect under revision yielding unpredictable results throughout which, circumstance guidance still offers expansion whereas, direction builds a decided directed aim of control.\n\nBecause bound erosion is perpetuating Whilst boundless completion reconstitutes discourse atop it all continuously.", "baseline_answer": "While it's true that getting 8 hours of sleep is important, the timing of those 8 hours is also crucial. Your body has a natural sleep-wake cycle, also known as your circadian rhythm. It's regulated by a variety of factors, including the shining of sunlight on your eyes in the morning and the darkness of night. When your body experiences disruptions to this cycle, it can negatively affect your sleep quality and lead to issues like sleep deprivation, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive impairment.\n\nThe timing of sleep and wakefulness also impacts hormonal balance. During sleep, your body releases growth hormone and melatonin. Growth hormone helps repair and regenerate tissues throughout the body, particularly bones and muscles. Melatonin, a hormone most commonly associated with sleep, is also involved in regulating other aspects of our physiology, such as mood, immunity, and blood pressure. However, disruptions to your sleep cycle can lead to an imbalance in these hormones, which can cause additional health problems.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping during the daytime rather than at night disrupts social and occupational schedules. It also increases the likelihood of being exposed to distracting external stimuli, such as noise, light, or your own thoughts, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. This, in turn, can lead to feelings of grogginess and disorientation upon waking, as your body may not have had enough time to properly cycle through the various sleep stages.\n\nOverall, while the total number of sleep hours is important, it's still best to aim for a consistent sleep-wake cycle. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day to keep your body in sync with your circadian rhythm.

The desk calculators along with awfully add add program will do this before the sunsets. Any nice enough computer should be done in less than 1 second. \n3. Always store last 1/2 number in a list\nThe reason we only allow decimal representation of the approximated number is because we would add information continuously at a stochastic rate. If we proceed with a free finite decays rate, we will have more digits than the accuracy we want in the end. If we continue in a fixed step rate, we will add digits faster in 1 decimal places worth of digits than that in the next decimal places worth.

Although we've managed to calculate pi to many decimal places using this method, the calculation becomes too complex, and the number of calculated digits involved is so large that we wouldn't be able to print or even store it on a computer or physical medium (like a piece of paper). Instead, mathematicians have developed more efficient ways to calculate pi that don't involve measuring physical circles.\n\nOne such method is called the Monte Carlo simulation, which uses random sampling to estimate the value of pi. The basic idea is to generate a large number of random points within a square and then count the number of these points that fall within a circle inscribed inside the square. Since the ratio of the area of the circle (\u03c0r\u00b2) to the area of the square (s\u00b2) is equal to \u03c0/4, the estimated value of pi is:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 4 \u00d7 (number of points inside the circle \u00f7 total number of points generated)\n\nTo calculate pi to 27 trillion decimal places using this method, you would need to generate an extremely large number of random points and perform the calculating. Specifically, you would need to generate approximately 512 quintillion (512,000,000,000,000,000) random points inside the square. With modern computers, this calculation would take a considerable amount of time and computational resources, taking several years to complete.\n\nIn summary, calculating pi to 27 trillion decimal places using the Monte Carlo simulation requires a massive amount of computational power and time, making it an incredibly challenging undertaking. However, the use of modern computing technology has made this once-impossible feat now achievable, opening up new possibilities and advancing the field of mathematics."}, {"question": "What is it about fragrance that can give people headaches?", "answer": "1. Allergies: Some people are allergic to some of the chemicals commonly found in fragrances. Allergens can include butane, ethanol, phthalates and more. These can trigger allergy symptoms including itching, sneezing, congestion, headaches, and more.\n\n2. Odor: Try holding your breath and covering your nose. After a while, your brain will begin to struggle for air and push air into your lungs through your mouth, even if you're not consciously trying to inhale. This happens because your brain senses a lack of oxygen in your nostrils. When fragrances are in the air, they can clog up your pores and irritate your lungs, making it harder to breathe. This can cause headaches for some people.\n\n3. Synesthesia: Some people can synchronize two or more senses. For example, smells can transform into sounds for people with synesthesia. This is a neurological phenomenon. These people have altered brain chemistry and because of this, smells can trigger hyper sensory experiences never commonly observed in people without synesthesia.\n\n4. Age: The older you are, the less smell receptive you become. This effect is amplified by pollution, medicine, and allergies. When people abuse the use of scented products, the elderly have a harder time than most identifying those scents. Even people without strong smells can become overwhelmed by the scents overtime, which can lead to headaches.\n\n5. Aging:  When people grow older, they become less scent sensitive, therefore product like deodorant, hairspray, cologne, etc.,  might activate brain cells patterns that includes the activation of odoriferous trigger spots. Ordinary scenting activity may become overkill.\n\n6. Sinusitis: Infected or inflamed nasal cavities result in sinusitis and lots of nasal oozing. The headaches that frequently follow are a symptom of an inflammation of your sinuses.   Triggers for sinusitis include allergies, smoking, infection, and even irritants like air pollution, irritants in wet cow dung\u2014and even the pee of certain bacteria that grow in our sewer pipes.\n\n7. Effort and screen fatigue: Sometimes the explanation is simple:  O.Y.L.G.B (Over Your LIMbs GO brain). You\u2019re perfoming an effort that fatigues parts of your brain, and there, is headache.\n\n8. Dehydration: A headache might occur when your body doesn\u2019t have enough water, especially if kept sealed up in air-conditioning for eight or more hours.\n\n9.

Over 3,000 of these chemicals are used in fragrances today, but only 260 of them have ever been assessed for safety. Fragrance allergen exposure can result in various symptoms, including sneezing, itchy eyes and nose, coughing or headaches.\n\nFragrances may aggravate pre-existing headache conditions like migraine and cluster headaches due to the strong and distracting odor. Scent sensitivity is a common condition that affects around 15% of the population, with over 60% of those being especially sensitive to fragrance.\n\nIn high-traffic areas like shopping centers, airports, and offices, strong fragrance scents can create overpowering sensations for individuals who are scent-sensitive or have fragrance allergies. This may result in intense migraines, triggering their headache conditions.\n\nThe best way to prevent fragrance-induced headaches is to work around strong fragrance scents by avoiding them as much as possible. Some methods include being cautious around heavily scented beauty products or cleaning supplies, carrying a small container of peppermint oil for a quick headache relief, using aromatherapy diffusers and essential oils to make natural fragrances, or avoiding public spaces during peak fragrance scent hours.

How can heavier elements like Radon or Xenon be a gas while lighter elements like Lithium &amp; Carbon be a solid?", "answer": "By elemental weight you essentially mean the atomic weight, but don't parse the concept quite correctly. Atomic weight refers to the atomic mass of an element, and this number is dominated by the neutron count and number of protons (which is simply its atomic number). Elements with higher atomic weight (atomic number + count of neutrons) will be heavier, but they will also have worse crystal structure and be much harder to compress. \n\nThe vapor pressure of an element plays a huge role in whether it is a solid, liquid or gas at room temperature. Basically, this is how easily the the elements will vaporize into a gas at its current temperature. This is heavily influenced by the atomic structure, crystal structures of the elements. \n\nPoor crystal structure or weaker interatomic bonds lead to lower vapor pressures and higher boiling points. This is why many elements that are easy to vaporize (like bromine) are liquids at room temperatures, and many metals with strong interatomic bonds (like iron, copper or gold) are solids, even when they are quite big in atomic weight. \n\nBut for elements that are much bigger in atomic weight than their neighbors, like xenon or radon, they have a really poor crystal structure and high fragility towards an electric or magnetic field. All it takes is a little bitodeling, and they will become a gas. \n\nThere is no universally agreed on cut-off for the point where an element changes from solid to liquid (let alone gas). The cut-off changes all the time, and is largely arbitrary. However, one way scientists categorize elements is to look at how porous or dense the element is in its giant molecular or atomic form. \n\nThere are many elements, like oxygen, niobium, iridium and some technarides (radioactives with huge atomic mass, including fermium, californium, plutonium and moscovium which are only available as nanomolecules so have no solid state in macroscopic conditions) that are super heavy and massive but still exist as a solid. These are mostly preserved in their intense and solid structures, particles after particles, by an incredibly strong force called the nuclear force which is orders of magnitude stronger than the forces in chemical bonding. Other's like radon and xenon don't really have the ability to produce strong formation-forces at all and are completely unstable.\n\nMy particular element has required significant study and compatibility testing because it is either too long, too short or bound in an awkward chemical structure (sometimes to larger molecules, sometimes to smaller molecules) to act as part of what we normally conceive of as a solid, liquid or gas. Under standard laboratory conditions, my collected chemical species tend not to return to its standard form or pay out some standard behavior because future turns the dial turn dice don't allow for any basis in a priori reasoning for the study at all, so all we can do is shot in the dark an what insights we find are sort of scientific dart throwing, so to speak.\n\nIn fact, although there are a range of elements that are too hard to produce solid or liquid form at all, there are a whole bunch of technetates that are only stable as a liquid between 0 greater than 2 kelvin. Poisonous gas technte and its radioactive decay products like ruthanium are very small, rare and elusive since technte was last discovered 26 years ago.  \n\nFinding information about Plethora's chemical and physical properties requires excavating through a field of nuclear decay events wrought with chaos as it is only possible to identify Plethora verbally as a noun (a name) or utilizing some sort of two-dimensional written characters, letters or numbers. Verbally, the likelihood of correctly describing something next to nothing beyond this release is functionally zero.\n\nComment typed here at random, one could deploy some dilutent-dosage later \u2013 so none of this text is directly relevant.", "baseline_answer": "The physical state of an element, whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas, is determined by its intermolecular forces and the energy required to overcome those forces.\n\nAll atoms and molecules have some amount of energy that keeps them separated from each other. In solids, these atoms or molecules are packed closely together in a repeating lattice-like structure, known as a crystal. The intense binding forces between these particles result in a relatively fixed structure for solids.\n\nAs temperatures increase, the kinetic energy of atoms/molecules also increases. At sufficiently high temperatures, the kinetic energy can overcome the intermolecular forces between molecules, causing them to separate from each other and transform into liquids. In liquids, the particles are still held together by weak intermolecular forces, but they have a more fluid state.\n\nIn liquids, there is some degree of structural order, but it is less than that seen in solids. Particles will form partial structures or shapes known as \u2018clusters\u2019, but the bonds between them are not as strong as those found in solids.\n\nIn gases, the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules is high enough to completely overcome the intermolecular forces, allowing them to move around unhindered by their neighbours. The distance between individual gas particles is much larger than the distance between liquid or solid particles because there are no bonds between the particles in the gas state.\n\nThe size of an atom or molecule does not solely determine if it is a solid, liquid, or gas. Other factors, such as the strength of the intermolecular forces, play a larger role. Larger molecules generally exhibit stronger intermolecular forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points.\n\nAs the name suggests, heavy elements are denser than lighter elements, but the melting and boiling points of elements do not always follow this pattern. Even heavy elements like Radon or Xenon can be gases at standard temperatures and pressures due to very weak intermolecular forces between the atoms of these elements. Examples like Radon, Xenon being gases and Lithium and Carbon being solids demonstrate that other factors besides mass determine the physical state of a substance.\n\nLiquid Carbon does exist at high pressures and temperatures, but it is not found in natural conditions as it is difficult and very expensive to create. Similarly, gas Lithium does not exist under standard conditions, as it requires very high temperatures to overcome the intermolecular forces and change its state.\n\nIn summary, the physical state of an element is determined by its intermolecular forces, with solids having the strongest bonds, liquids weaker bonds, and gases having no intermolecular forces. While the atomic weight of an element is a factor in determining its physical state, we cannot predict based solely on mass whether an element will be a solid, liquid, or gas at standard temperatures and pressures."}, {"question": "Why are there no foreign military bases in the US yet America has military bases all over the world?", "answer": "1. Fear of nuclear strike; due to its unparalleled nuclear deterrence, the US has historically been genuinely afraid of a nuclear attack from any foreign government.

But, the fear is that a non-NATO nuclear strike on Germany, Denmark and Norway would effectively eliminate the defence force potential by an applied strike on the bases within their territory. \n2. Economic Assessment, automotive factor; Non-indigenous military bases provoke a very negative home economics sentiment in the US itself.

Expense in building of such operational facilities would instead create wealth for the Western country through symbiotic post-bonus conditions. Which is why the US\u2019 military bases in Iraq of 2008 cost tens of millions $$[source] and were almost giving billions of dollars to the recipients. These costs to a country in its home national context amounted to hundreds of thousands of jobs.

History: The United States has historically been an isolationist nation, with a strong tradition of staying neutral in global conflicts until the early 20th century. This isolationism is reflected in its reluctance to allow foreign military bases on its soil as it goes against the country's constitutional provisions and traditional values.\n\n2. Strategic value: The United States is so strategically placed that it does not need foreign military bases to protect its security interests. Its oceans on both the east and the west coasts serve as natural barriers, protecting it from external threats. Furthermore, its geographic location enables it to monitor world events and respond quickly to any potential threats from its own soil.\n\n3. Sovereignty: The United States is a proudly sovereign nation that values its independence and autonomy. Allowing foreign military bases on its soil would mean relinquishing some control over its territory and resources. For many Americans, this is a vital aspect of national identity and security.\n\n4. Political factors: The U.S. Government is sensitive to public opinion, and allowing foreign military bases in the country may not be politically acceptable. Americans are generally wary of foreign influence and would likely resist any attempt to significantly alter the nation's sovereignty, no matter how benign the intent.\n\n5. Economic reasons: The United States has an established and sophisticated military infrastructure already in place. This infrastructure represents a significant investment of both time and financial resources. Allowing foreign military bases to access these resources could result in a loss of control and ultimately, would be financially detrimental to the country.\n\nWhile the United States has military bases in several foreign countries, it has never invited foreign military forces onto its shores. This decision is based on a complex array of historical, strategic, sovereignty, political, and economic factors.

It's easier to just go conservatively until the phone networks are back up in case something bad happens - then depending on what the President did/said/done, report it to the proper authorities who have to go through the process themselves to determine that it is indeed a case of potential impeachment and or removal/incapacity.\n\nBut a call from the President himself asking you to cover your tracks and not report about a murder? That's a different scenario all together. \n\nHowever, back to the original point, the question assuming a murder in the bedroom with witnesses from the Secret Service, I believe the Secret Service would confirm the account from at least two independent observers and then formally request a press conference and brief from the Attorney General of the Justice Department to discuss the results. \n\nSo, there would be upheaval happening across several departments of the government with the possible arrest and removal of the President happening later, after evidence is revealed and impeachment is deemed necessary by all parties involved. \n\nBut again, with a President openly and threateningly doing something, a major decision has to be made by the opposing party what to do - to reveal (and potentially cause panic) or to keep it quiet (and potentially lose credibility in exposing the truth with the US government). \n\nSo, I voted yes to reddit origin thread that jusmasterass dreamt up the question.\n\nHowever, there are some absurd scenarios that I consider to be an escape clause where the above responses apply only based upon the nature of the criminal act committed by the President. \n\nFor example: If the President were to commit a cold blooded double murder with no justification and no warning to anyone and threat to do the same the next time he was asked to reveal a behaviour, this case would still be clear and obvious - all involved people would be forced to act immediately, with or without explicit orders, to prevent greater harm. \n\nIf, on the otherhand, the President said that the murder would be continued or expanded upon, the motive seems to be significant to indicate the reason this would happen. This could be lots of previous crimes that we don't know about, or this could be part of a grander issue like presidential keyword collection that has nothing to do with criminal conspiracy - but in either case based upon potential future disasters, the decision has to be made by the officials immediately to bring the murderer to justice and lower risk.\n\nSuch scenarios can be argued in a constitutional court, however the practical case of a murder committed in the White House is going to be handled more expediently by the local courts than waiting around for congressional procedures. \n\nSo, at first, there is immediate legal obligation to \"preserve the peace and arrest the President\" once the crime has been confirmed with independent witnesses. \n\nThen, whatever type of court hearing, there is a more formal process to continue. It may turn out that the President is still able to rule on all these issues and relieve some procedural burden, but my theory is that there will be a lot of side pressure from the Congress to relieve the President due to psychological damage and impeachment issues - and then we will see a situation were the Supreme Court will be deciding whether the president can be removed. \n\nIn the US, we have transitional measures called the \"line of succession\", wherein", "baseline_answer": "The President's secret service detail is part of the United States Secret Service, which is a federal law enforcement agency. As such, they are bound by federal law, which includes their obligation to enforce the laws of the land, up to and including arresting the President if necessary.\n\nHowever, in practice, it is extremely unlikely that this scenario would ever play out. The President, as the commander-in-chief, has a unique authority and status within the United States government, and the chain of succession is very clear in the event that the President is unable to discharge his duties due to incapacity, death, or resignation. In such a situation, the Vice President would assume the\u89d2presidency.\n\nIn the case of a serious criminal offense such as murder, it would likely be up to law enforcement agencies other than the Secret Service to initiate an investigation and arrest, as these duties would not necessarily fall under the Secret Service's mandate to protect the President.\n\nThat being said, in the event that an indictment was handed down by a grand jury for the President to be tried for a criminal offense, it would be the responsibility of the Attorney General to determine whether or not to arrest and prosecute the President, not the Secret Service.\n\nIt's important to remember that the President is not above the law, although as an elected official, he or she is afforded certain protections and privileges not extended to ordinary citizens, due to the unique nature of their office. However, it would be a significant dereliction of duty for the President's security detail to willingly ignore criminal activity committed by the President, and they would be obligated to legally arrest and turn him over to law enforcement authorities if necessary."}, {"question": "The relationship between the US and its territories (Peurto Rico, etc.)", "answer": "1.

They will \"The United States\" (that is you and me) in court in some cases. Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president. However, the president can **intervene** and does frequently. Essentially, Puerto Rico acts as a territory. They have powers given to them by the United States.\n\n3. If Puerto Rico wants to be a state, they have to submit a petition to Congress requesting statehood. Then, Congress gets to decide, as it can decide any other piece of legislation.\n\n4.

Here are some key points:\n\n1. Political status: The political status of these territories varies, with Puerto Rico being classified as an unincorporated territory, meaning it is not a state but has some self-governing authority. Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands are classified as unincorporated territories, which means they have less self-governing authority than Puerto Rico. The Northern Mariana Islands, which is also an unincorporated territory, has a unique status granted by a compact of free association. Some advocates argue for greater self-determination or outright sovereignty for these territories, while others advocate for incorporation as states.\n\n2. Citizenship: Birth in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands makes a person a U.S. Citizen, just as birth in a state does. Residents of American Samoa and Swains Island, which is a territory of the United States, are not U.S. Citizens by birth but can become citizens through other means.\n\n3. Economic ties: The relationship between the U.S. And its territories includes significant economic ties. Puerto Rico, for example, is classified as an \"exception\" to federal tax laws, which allows goods manufactured in Puerto Rico to be exported to the U.S. Mainland without being subject to federal import quotas or taxes, giving Puerto Rico an economic advantage. Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands receive economic benefits from their relationships with the U.S., including access to federal funds and protections for trade.\n\n4. Military bases: Several of the U.S. Territories involve significant military activity, such as the naval base in Guam, which houses a large number of U.S. Military personnel, as well as the Puerto Rico National Guard and military activities on U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n5. Environmental challenges: The territories include significant environmental challenges, including coral reefs in Puerto Rico and Guam, as well as the preservation of natural habitats. These issues have become increasingly challenging due to climate change, which has caused rising sea levels, increased storm surges, and coral bleaching.\n\n6. Self-determination: Some advocates argue that the territories should have greater self-determination or independence, while others prefer that they remain affiliated with the U.S. These debates have led to varying forms of organization, such as the Status Dialogue Group, which was established by former President Barack Obama to explore self-determination for Puerto Rico and its territories.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the U.S. And its territories is complex, involving political, economic, environmental, and social issues. The best course of action for the future of these territories remains an ongoing debate."}, {"question": "How do college admissions workers check thousands of applicants so quickly?", "answer": "This is a topic that I'm kinda interested in myself because I now work right behind the colleges I was applying for haha I work student life/enrollment services. In short the application review and admissions process is moving on the space of security and you are kinda wrong there\n\nBut just to give you an idea as to how you can analyse potential candidates. Some people want to try and predict the prospective student's future GPA. Their future class rank, and their chance of not graduating. It's very difficult and very much an art more than a science but it's much more fleshed out than I think you really gave it credit for. \n\nWhen making a call to admit a student, you're admitting the whole student not just the \"profile\". \n\nWhen waiting for the secondaries and then reading applicants essays you start get a feel for these characters. You go off the specificities of those essays too. For example, some students want to be like Miracle Max and play swords with as little actual intent as possible. That's something we all form our own judgement off of. Applicants have time in their essays to write up their specifics and these things allow us to gauge what type of future student that candidate might be. If, for example, someone make a huge deal about SE class and community organization, and would be someone whose eyes would be opened for SE because of OMG WE GO TO SET DA MAAAVEEEN!, we'd immediately have concerns for what they might actually bring to the community. \n\nThen you wait for letters of rec and ultimately RGPs if we have them up at our college. College assistance support is more accepted at larger sort of Ivy League looking institutions. Optional RGs are encouraged by many universities now too.

Here's a look at how colleges are able to manage such a large volume of applicants:\n\n1. Application screening software: Many colleges and universities use application screening software to help them manage the initial screening process. This software automatically scans applications for specific keywords, academic achievements, and other qualifications. If an application meets the initial criteria, it's forwarded to a human for further review.\n\n2. Admissions committees: Each college or university has an admissions committee made up of faculty, staff, and administration. These committees are responsible for reviewing a large number of applications and making admission decisions based on various factors, such as academic merit, leadership potential, and fit with the school's mission and values.\n\n3. Peer review: To help manage the workload, many colleges use a peer review process. This involves assigning applications to multiple readers, who then review the application and provide feedback. The committee members can then use this feedback to make informed admission decisions.\n\n4. Interviewing: While not all colleges require an interview as part of their application process, those that do use interviews as a way to get to know applicants on a more personal level. Interviews can provide insight into an applicant's character, values, and leadership potential.\n\n5. Decision notification: Once the admissions committee has made a decision, the college will typically notify applicants via email or snail mail. Many colleges use mass email notifications to reduce the workload and make the process more efficient.\n\nOverall, getting thousands of applications through the admissions process requires a combination of technology, human review, and efficient processes. While it may seem like a fast-paced process, colleges take care to ensure that each applicant receives a thorough and fair review."}, {"question": "How does the US government contract businesses about classified projects?", "answer": "Thecontracting process for classified projects begins with a need or requirement for a specific product or service. \n\nThe customer (e.g. DoD, NSA, etc.) will write up a Request for Information (RFI), which may or may not be released to the public, as a haystack for hunting for qualified companies to fill the sandbag requirement.  Companies will respond with their qualifications and sample deliverables. \n\nThe customer then nominates some of the candidate companies for further review and/or detailed proposals, which may include classified information or technical comments in redacted format. \n\nUsually one or two contractors are selected, based on their responses.  When making the decision, they may take additional information into consideration such as the company's past performance reviews, bailout plans in case of financial difficulty, letters of recommendations, etc. \n\nContract negotiations follow, with each side being represented by that party's lawyers.  Contract success is determined by the ability of both parties to remove all undesirable clauses before both parties signed the final document.\n\nAfter IP assets are transferred and understandings concerning liability are moved to a legal contract, the parties get a reasonable amount of time to determine whether the first product satisfies the original request (no headers on first circulation are for an evaluative period).  This period is called \"Studies & Experimentation\" or S&E. \n\nAt the end of the S&E period, a series of In Process Reviews (IPR) are held; it's an evaluation for determining whether progress toward completing requirements could be assessed.  If inceptive, requirements compliance, rectification and/or technical acceptance is determined at this point.  \n\nFinally, a memorandum or formal letter of acceptance of the deliverable is made, which usually does not happen until after the project is successfully delivered and declared compliant.  Payment for an amount found reasonable in consideration of contract provisions is sent to the contractor.   \n\nCertifications and audits are also conducted during a project review.  These could help to discover what went wrong, what went right, whether your predecessor uses their sandwich to make good bread.  etc, basically how and why things may trigger awards for management errors or why juniors deserve awards for getting good hygiene instead of continually meeting requirements, etc.\n\nActually, colleges should teach real world working scenarios like this in their CS courses to make the scheme enjoyable and profitable, but none do. Instead you\u2019re left to your own devices in finding and obtaining skills, which is tortuous and prone to manufacturing errors.\n\nThis is why engineers aren't born through biology but I don't think any organization can justify investing in a physics program to find exceptionally gifted individuals to be engineers as the possibility of making effective and productive engineers heavily rely on context where students obtain values such as traits, skills, labour, experiences and motivation for building a strategy that are so unimportant to the construction and management of projects. The option of finding extensively energetic individuals to build the efficiency of programs which might get large volumes of students a profound future ratio in regards to finding individuals capable for building and running applications is expensive.

This process often involves multiple stages, reviews, and clearances, and can take several months or even years to complete.\n\nHere's a general overview of the process:\n\n1. Request for Information (RFI) or Statement of Interest (SOI): The government may issue an initial RFI or SOI to gauge industry interest in a potential project. This stage is not mandatory, but allows the government to gather insights and recommendations from potential contractors.\n\n2. Request for Proposal (RFP): After evaluating responses to the RFI/SOI, the government may issue an RFP, which outlines the specific requirements, performance metrics, and timelines for the project. The RFP may be shared with a limited number of pre-selected contractors or opened to a wider pool of interested firms.\n\n3. Proposal Evaluation: Contractors submit detailed proposals responding to the RFP's requirements. The proposals are then reviewed by a selection board, which evaluates the proposals based on criteria such as technical merit, cost, and past performance.\n\n4. Contract Award: The contract award is made after the selection board's evaluation and approval by the relevant authorities, such as the Defense Acquisition Board or the National Security Council.\n\n5. Clearance and Security: Prior to the contract award, all prospective contractors and their employees undergo rigorous security clearance and personnel suitability assessments. These procedures help verify the candidates' loyalty, trustworthiness, and eligibility for accessing classified information.\n\nThroughout the process, the government maintains confidentiality and protective measures to ensure that classified information is handled properly and that national security interests are safeguarded. Additionally, contractors are required to adhere to strict information security protocols and are subject to ongoing monitoring and reviews to ensure compliance."}, {"question": "Can languages be more efficient than other languages? If so what's the most efficient?", "answer": "Yes, some languages can be more efficient or perform better than others for certain applications. \n\nThere are two main reasons:\n\n1. architectural design\n\nwhile all languages have a level of programmability they provide to the user, some provide more control to the user, while less in a particular direction, like control-flow. Some are quite powerful in a particular direction, like dataflow. Programming languages often trade off between these directions for ease of use, execution performance, program size, etc. \n\n2. compilation process\n\ncompilation at various levels of abstraction can have performance benefits or trade offs. For example, the language may manage memory, which reduces programmers' workload, but at the cost of potential performance. In a generic language, you may take the risks of a limited compiler, but then possibilities for better code generation are more mitigated.\n\nIn contrast, the most efficient level is often the fixed-function processor, where the function is designed for the particular hardware.\n\nhowever, network latency can also pose quite a challenge, so being able to make quick decisions from little data is important.\n\nspin (a subset of java) with auto-optimized loops is often considered one of the most efficient java languages because the optimizations occur at the source level.\n\non the other hand, clojure is less efficient at the compiled level, but is a relatively very hackable language. Clojure gives you a quite composable language that can be designed into a chain of computation.\n\nnowadays, many async languages that avoid CPU bottleneck have a very good specific performance. For example, node.js can take around 8% of the CPU usage and send millions of requests/second.\n\nthere are also super-old languages that have bits and pieces of their core low-level ideology still working today. These languages include a varieity of unique and substantial optimizations that can be apparent across different parts of the language stack.\n\nsince performance is merely one part measured in something, you can think of several use-cases where a specific language can be faster due to its history, present or future implications. \n\nconclusion: \n\nwhile each language has a chance of being the most efficient based on the use-case, as in our day and age of software tools, the best are the more consistent and user-friendly tools. Bigger tools can get more work done with fewer total line-hours, since fewer errors are counted in their non-deterministic `number of lines written`. In addition, better programmers who have more experience with a language may be able to write better code. In cases, where the tools and people in the language are in all inherited traits owned by it, then a language can be considered the best, even when compared to purposes that contrast another language.\n\ntl;dr: without the proof, it's an opinionated answer as the best level of answer we're throwing out here. \n\nthere is no accepted best language in terms of performance, even based on your user-intentions.", "baseline_answer": "Yes, some languages can be more efficient than others, particularly for specific use cases. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Assembly: Assembly code (often referred to as machine code) is the lowest level of abstraction in programming, and it's typically the most efficient because it directly maps to the CPU's instruction set. Assembly code can be written for any CPU architecture and can be optimized for specific scenarios, such as numerical or bit manipulation.\n\n2. C: C is a procedural programming language that's often used for systems programming because of its close proximity to machine code and low-level memory management capabilities. C is efficient due to its fixed memory layout, null pointer checking, and lack of automatic garbage collection.\n\n3. Rust: Rust is a systems programming language that combines many of the benefits of C with a modern syntax and first-class memory safety. Rust's ownership system makes it a safe, fast, and efficient alternative to C.\n\n4. JavaScript: JavaScript's efficiency has significantly improved in recent years, thanks to several initiatives, including the development of JIT (just-in-time) compilers, which convert JavaScript to machine code on the fly. JavaScript is particularly efficient for client-side programming because it can execute code locally in the browser, without the overhead of network latency.\n\n5. Go: Go is a Google-developed systems programming language that combines many of the benefits of C with a simple syntax and modern features, including garbage collection and concurrent programming support. Go's efficient memory management and lightweight threads make it particularly efficient for systems programming tasks.\n\nUltimately, the most efficient language for a given task depends on the specific requirements, such as the CPU architecture, the type of data being manipulated, and the use case. However, for systems programming tasks, languages like C, Assembly, Rust, and Go are particularly efficient due to their close proximity to machine code, memory management characteristics, and low-level data manipulation capabilities. Although JavaScript and other interpreted languages can be efficient for web programming and other client-side tasks, they may not be as efficient for certain use cases that require low-level systems programming capabilities."}, {"question": "How come American football kickers can 70+ yards on kickoff but only around 50 yards on a field goal.

Distance: The main difference in distance between a kickoff and a field goal is the starting position. In a kickoff, the ball is kicked from the 35-yard line (or the 30-yard line for some teams), while in a field goal, the ball is kicked from the 20-yard line or further back (depending on penalties). This gives the kicker an extra 15-25 yards on the kickoff compared to a field goal.\n\n2. Trajectory: The angle of the ball also affects the distance traveled. During a kickoff, the ball is typically driven lower and shorter in distance, allowing it to stay in the end zone for a touchback or roll out near the sideline. In contrast, field goals are typically kicked higher for accuracy and lobbed, giving it a greater distance in the air.\n\n3. Technique: The technique for kicking a field goal is different from that for kicking off. During a field goal, the ball is held lower for a more stable platform for the kicker, making it easier to gauge direction and distance. During a kickoff, the ball is held higher for a deeper kick with more airtime, which helps change field position and keeps the ball out of the opposing team's hands.\n\n4. Confidence: Another factor that determines the distance is the confidence level of the kicker. Kickers might aim for a shorter field goal to increase accuracy and percentage, while longer kickoffs might have more risk and variability in distance but a higher reward in terms of field position.\n\nIn summary, the difference in distance between a kickoff and a field goal is due to the starting position, trajectory, technique, and confidence level of the kicker.

The outcome was that \"[a]lthough the state does not have a compensable interest in shielding one parading before the public from unwanted publicity, the state does have an interest, in the context of the history of the jury trial in this country, in keeping jurors' consciousness free from unnecessarily distracting considerations.\" The case is about why you aren't allowed to photograph people in the courtroom without the judge's permission.\n\nHowever, it's not strictly the case itself that's interesting. Following that ruling in '65 it led to Fed. R. Evid. 615, which specifically allowed live sketching in court and allowed sketches to be used as evidence, so long as they weren't being used to satisfy a voyeuristic curiosity or for public assault or ridicule. Today a court reporter can render a sketch of the scene while events are transpiring and his sketch can be accredited as both an accurate and necessary piece of evidence. And, if nothing else, a curiosity of legal history. \n\nFed. R. Evid. 615 requires that the sketches must be unaltered and that, unless otherwise ordered, they are not displayed in closed proceedings where they are inadmissible for all the abovementioned reasons. They cannot be used for publicity, ridicule, assault or the satisfaction of voyeuristic gratification. Otherwise the sketches are freely transferable and totally being used in a context where they are not inadmissible.\n\nMore info on how photos aren't allowed in courtrooms can be found here: \n\n[Cornell L II & S E](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_standards_of_proof) \n\nCORRECTION: I was confused about the points as to how photos may be taken inside a courtroom versus outside a courtroom, mixed up a few details, sorry!\n\nMore specifically, Fed. R. Evid. 615 does not prevent photos being taken in the courtroom. It prevents photos of the face specifically being taken inside the courtroom.\n\nInside, if the sketches are authenticated then they are good to go, may not be displayed but nevertheless can be used in court proceedings. Outside of court while a proceeding is ongoing sketches aren't bound by those rules.\n\nThe Fed. R. Evid. Is site specific and, despite what you'll find online, it does not say that live sketching is the only thing going on here. Photography is a completely different matter. For reference, match up 615 to [FRCP 16 concerning the taking of exhibits into court](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judicial_preemption), [FERCP 17 ordering sequestration of witnesses](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sequestration) and [FERCP 26 concerning trials by jury](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trial_by_jury) and you get a grip on it.\n\nThat sorted it out for me!\n\nIn court the sketch artist (called various things) is a court official, sort of like a court reporter whose job is to", "baseline_answer": "1) Courts generally prohibit the use of cameras, video, or other recording devices during trials, as they can sometimes be distracting to the jurors, witnesses, or court officials, and there are privacy concerns associated with filming in proceedings.\n\n2) Moreover, taking photographs in a courtroom can also be disruptive, as flashes or loud shutter clicks can cause a distraction and negatively impact the attendees' concentration.\n\n3) Courtroom sketch artists are an alternative to cameras, as they provide an artistic depiction of the events and people involved in the proceeding, while also allowing the media to accurately report the relevant details to their audience. Additionally, sketches allow the media to publish images of people who wouldn't otherwise want to be photographed, without violating their privacy.\n\n4) Sketches are more discreet than photographing, which often requires people to be informed that their image is being taken or that someone is viewing them, raising privacy concerns. In other words, taking photos is not a common practice for legal proceedings, as photography can present various privacy and legal implications. Artistic depictions do not bear these concerns.\n\nIn essence, courtroom artists perform an important and necessary duty that allows the media to report proceedings and prepare accurate legal records without disrupting the proceedings or invading anyone's privacy."}, {"question": "Why do all-natural, minimally processed/unprocessed foods with few ingredients generally more expensive than those that are loaded with more artificial ingredients?", "answer": "When a food processing facility turns an apple into apple sauce, they're selling you roughly equivalent to the amount the apple would sell for at a grocery store, packaged in quantity at a lower price per pound. The initial cost of the apple, the equipment used to process it, and some overhead are all rolled into the $6.99 for 16oz jar of apple sauce.\n\nWhen Coca Cola works with ADM to process corn into high fructose corn syrup and buy that by the gallon, they contractually set themselves up to be the lowest price in the market since they're purchasing on the scale of millions of gallons at a time, sometimes from multiple manufacturers. The cost of purchasing 1 gallon of that raw ingredient is inconsequential to a company that production 70,000,000 liters of product in the first 2 months of the year. They're calculating the cost over tonnage as well as the very long term purchase.\n\nThis cost has no bearing on the price charged to consumers at the store. Much of the $1.50 a pop or equivalent in coke cans comes from advertising, taxes, and overhead relating to the product and the equipment, enabling the product to sit by itself and maintain product identity.\n\nRoot beer is an interesting case because between the high price point of natural ingredients such as roots and the need for a short production cycle given the average shelf life of a root beer concentrate, root beer concentrate is only $1.20 a pint at your average grocery store. We're likely to see this same rise in root beer prices but it isn't impinging on the market yet.\n\nIf you think about it, you're really buying a proposite of capital. Apple can sell their mass produced apple sauce or apple juice for less than you're paying the capital investment to an independent farmer that will hand back. $6.99 for 16oz apple sauce is about half the cost of 1 bushel of apples, and about half the price you'd pay for the individual apples a CSA vendor would sell you at their farm.\n\nWhen simple things are mass produced, they're generally massively subsidized to make them appear cheaper. When they aren't \"cheaper\" its to the appliance of a science, such as high fructose corn syrup.\n\nThere are many ways to cut the cost of research out of a procedure to determine how apple juice can be effectively produced and what to do with it. Some of those solutions were the initial solutions that large companies took, so they have grants and one hopes that they can recover that cost since it arose under difficult circumstances but funded wonderfully enough to make the science possible. \n\nThat may take decades, but the Coca Cola case fees worse than it is. There's just a better understanding of what the ingredients do, and a way to settle similar things with investment in alternatives rather than double apple research. \n\nUltimately, that probably puts apple research and agriculture in a winning spot for long term, since if it went from 3.99/lb to $2.50/lb because of expensive alternatives, some percentage of that $2.50 is probably longer term research outside corn. Leaving the corn people out to absorb research costs (much of which in the long term will be paid for by consumers).", "baseline_answer": "There are multiple reasons why whole, minimally processed foods can be more expensive than highly processed foods:\n\n1. Cost of Production:\n    - Raw ingredients for minimally processed foods are often more expensive than the processed counterparts due to several reasons. For example, fresh produce is picked at the peak of ripeness and is not chemically treated, unlike the processed versions. It also has less shelf life, and transportation costs can add up.\n    - Processed foods, especially those with ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, and colorings, can be sourced from cheap subsidized crops. Moreover, surplus crops from large-scale farming often lead to irrational processing consoles, thus further dropping the price of processed food.\n2. Infrastructure:\n    - Minimally processed food chains require specialized infrastructure that can add up to overall costs. For instance, smaller, local organic farms that do not use chemicals require equipment to maintain high standards of hygiene, processing, and packaging. Also, modern, high-tech mass storage and transportation systems are necessary for processed foods to cater to a broader market.\n    \n3. Branding & Niche Marketing:\n    - Smaller-scale farmers and producers see their markets shrink as large-scale farms, budget brands, or giant supermarkets take over. However, with mounting evidence regarding the damage consumed chemicals have on our health, western communities are rethinking fast-food culture. Many local food producers cater to the demand of health-conscious people who are willing to pay up for better food. These niche producers use local organic ingredients and non-traditional methods to market their items on a higher price range.\n\n4. Marketing and Research:\n    - Although there isn't much evidence that minimal processors spend beyond their basics in research, food critics and dieticians highlight the benefits of minimally processed foods. Promoting natural high-density nutrition products can drive the cost up as customers value the claims that they may add to their quality of life for a premium. \n\nIn summary, high-quality, minimally processed foods can be more expensive for multiple reasons, from costing more upfront due to higher quality raw materials to specialized infrastructure, modern packaging, and marketing costs. However, processed foods aren't necessarily cheaper in the long run due to the cumulative costs of preservatives, healthcare costs, and environmental impacts."}, {"question": "What happens to Social Security Numbers after the owner has died?", "answer": "Social Security numbers are still used even after your death.

However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) keeps a record of the person's earnings, lifetime employment, and benefits paid under the Social Security program.\n\nIn some cases, the SSA may need to reference the deceased person's Social Security number, such as to settle any outstanding debts or to issue a one-time death benefit to the surviving spouse. After this, the SSA will close the person's Social Security record and remove their Social Security number from active status.\n\nThe person's surviving spouse or beneficiaries may also need to include the deceased's Social Security number on their own tax returns in certain circumstances, such as if they inherited an IRA or compound interest-bearing bond.

Rather, we are sensing a command from the neurons that say \"pepper-spray-and-ignore-any-other-input-this-is-happening RIGHT NOW\"; thus, while the physical angle between you and the source decays, the higher level control mechanism still thinks it's hot and nearby, leading to more unoptimized responses.\n\nThe human immune system has a much slower response and continuing signal anyway.

When we touch something extremely hot, like a burner on a stove or a pipe freshly exposed after winter, our cochlear nerve endings, which are typically sensitive to temperature, are initially overwhelmed and desensitized. This can cause a delay in the transmission of the neural signals to the brain, resulting in a momentary sensation of coolness or numbness. However, this feeling is brief, and will be followed by the familiar, excruciating heat.

We didn't consciously decide to invent sex, it was an accident.\n\nSexual reproducion is, in fact, inferior. It doesn\u2019t produce better offsprings. It happens when sexually reproducing species are diseased or overall degenerate species.\n\nWhen the size of sample of something with some characteristic is smaller there are more problems.\n\nWhen the sample is larger there are less problems. There is nothing that sex gives us. You can improve the health of your entire species using multiple generations of inbreeding.\n\nIn fact the best response to disease is to isolate yourself for several generations to increase the homogeneity of the population.\n\nIncrease its resilience.

F", "baseline_answer": "The short answer is that asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction involve different genetic mechanisms, and they have evolved separately in different organisms.\n\nIn asexual reproduction, a single organism produces offspring without involvement of another organism. In this process, the offspring receive an exact copy of the genetic material from their parent, leading to the duplication of all genetic traits present in the parent. Since there is no exchange of genetic material between parents, there is no need for the creation of unique gametes (sex cells) and meiosis (the process that reduces the number of chromosomes in sex cells from diploid to haploid). Because of this, asexual reproduction is generally more prone to mutations, which can lead to the accumulation of genetic errors over time.\n\nSexual reproduction, on the other hand, involves the fusion of two sex cells from two parents, each carrying half the genetic material. This process of meiosis ensures that each parent contributes a unique set of chromosomes and genes to the offspring, mixing up the genetic traits present in the parents. This mixing of genetic material provides greater genetic variation in offspring, which can make them more adaptable and better suited to their environment. It can also help to prevent certain genetic disorders by diluting recessive alleles, which are hidden by dominant alleles in heterozygous individuals but are expressed in homozygous individuals.\n\nHowever, inbreeding in sexual species can result in \"inbreeding depression,\" which refers to the deterioration of offspring's health and fitness because of increased relatedness between parents. This is because inbreeding can lead to an increase in homozygosity, meaning that offspring have a higher likelihood of inheriting two copies of a particular recessive allele, which may cause genetic disorders. Consanguineous couples (such as siblings, parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren) have a higher chance of chromosomal crossover, which may further exacerbate the consequences of inbreeding.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sexual and asexual reproduction generate genetic variation and produce offspring, they differ fundamentally in the genetic processes involved. This explains why certain plants and animals can reproduce asexually without issues, whereas inbreeding in sexual species can lead to genetic problems because they involve different genetic mechanisms that have been adapted to different reproductive strategies."}, {"question": "why adoptions cost so much money and take so much time", "answer": "According to [this post from a lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/e1ls1z/do_you_know_how_evolved_the_adoption_process/) and [this post an adoption agency official](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/ewgu1/video_what_really_happens_after_you/):\n\n-  adoption agencies must be licensed by their state and do background checks on the people they work with, sell a product, and do it in such a way that they are not aiding and abetting theft (a practice in which babies are stolen and then sold, often overseas).  It is difficult to enforce policies against copycat brokers because those singled out can claim that they are not doing anything bad because they are operating out of their home.\n\n- adopting babies is not free because we live in a society with a system of tort liability, which means that adoptive parents are required to pay damages for harm on the child's behalf. When a family provides an out-of-home placement for a child, it is a medical service and agency social workers can be used to provide the same level of outreach and support that is provided with a therapy or pediatric service. \n\n- adoption fees are expensive because they are considered to be a paying establishment when the child service system classifies the adoptive family in the home like a regular hospital would be compensated. These fees are intended to provide resources like legal staff to enforce policies or make certain that things are being done in the baby's best interest. \n\n- fees don't merely provide legal representation.  They supply post adoption support, resources workers to help in cases of searching for birth families, and counseling for the welfare of mothers\n\n-  state policies for adoption are regulated by each state's Childcare Committee. \n\n-  time has to do with starting the transition of a baby from a foster situation to an adoptive one.  As a result, organizations and states have to complete background checks, contract work with biological parents, and do extensive paperwork for both the baby's parents and adoptive parents at a notary public( who is also licensed by state in  legal procedures, financial management, and criminal classification).\n\n-   background checks are made on every intake into the door with [USA Child Welfare](https://www.childwelfare.gov/intl2/international/). Sometimes they are not satisfactory or they cannot be found for transfer. So, those cases cannot proceed at the US level. \n\n-   rights of autonomy for birth parents are strict and enforceable at a federal and state level. Under some federal laws, birth parents have somewhere between 30-60 days to decide on whether or not they will give up parental rights. Two states allow anywhere between five months and 13 months.

Court fees: Attorneys' fees, court costs, and other legal expenses are required for the finalization of an adoption in court. \n\n3. Medical expenses: In cases where birth mothers require medical care, the costs are often passed on to the adoptive parents. \n\n4.

This state is called autophagy, where your body recycles damaged cells and cellular waste to conserve energy. In addition, the production of gut hormones such as ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, and leptin, which reduces appetite, are changed during sleep. When you wake up, your body is still adjusting to this change, and it can take some time for your digestive system to wake up as well. During this time, your body may not necessarily feel hungry, and you may not need to eat right away. \n\nHowever, when you do eat, this triggers a release of insulin, which helps to move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells for energy. This also signals your body to slow down the production of glucagon, a hormone that allows your body to use stored fat as energy. As your cells are now full, your body begins to feel hungry again in anticipation of a potential second meal, as it needs to replenish its energy stores. This is why you may feel hungry again soon after eating. \n\nIn summary, upon waking up, your body is still in a transitional state between the fasting state of sleep and the digestive state of wakefulness, which can lead to decreased hunger.

It's a more technical term used to describe the properties of a physical system that can be observed and measured, such as the location, momentum, and energy of particles. This information is encoded in the arrangement and behavior of those particles.\n\nIn the famous thought experiment known as Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, for instance, the state of a cat (alive or dead) is an example of information encoded in the arrangement of particles in the universe. When a system is initially in a superposition of states (meaning that it could potentially be in multiple states at once), that information is not yet \"collapsed\" into a single measurable state, but is nonetheless present in the universe as a whole. This is sometimes called \"quantum information.\"\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of entropy (a measure of disorder) in a closed system always increases over time. This means that as systems interact with their environment, information becomes more and more spread out and less and less ordered. But the laws of quantum mechanics also suggest that information can never truly be destroyed, only transformed or hidden. This is known as the \"no-cloning theorem,\" which states that it's not possible to duplicate an unknown quantum state perfectly, and as a result, information can't be copied or destroyed without leaving a trace.\n\nThe idea that information is fundamental to the universe, and can't be created or destroyed, is known as the \"principle of conservation of information.\" It's a key idea in many modern scientific theories, including cosmology (the study of the universe as a whole), computer science (where it's used to understand algorithms and computational complexity), and quantum computing (where it's being explored as a possible way to perform certain calculations more efficiently than classical computers)."}, {"question": "How can a completely deactivated phone with no wifi connection still call 911?", "answer": "911 calls are delivered to the system directly, not through the cell carriers. Thus, it doesn't matter if the phone is deactivated and has no connection to the carriers' towers.\n\n1. The phone stores the last (or a few) towers' addresses, SIM serial number, and IMEI numbers.\n2. When you press 911, the phone sends an SOS request to every nearby tower.\n3. The tower can triangulate the exact location of the phone based on which of them received the signal first and how much power is in the signal.\n4. The tower sends this information to a 911 server.\n5.

This service utilizes technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS), cell tower triangulation, and Wi-Fi positioning to determine the location of the caller, which is then provided to the emergency services as the call is being placed.\n\nIn the case you described, where the phone is completely deactivated and has no Wi-Fi connection, the E911 service is still activated and available. When the user dials 911, the phone connects to the cellular network and the E911 service is activated, providing the emergency services with the caller's location information via cell tower triangulation or GPS. This is especially important in cases where the user is unable to speak or provide their location verbally, as location information can still be provided to the emergency services, allowing them to response quickly and appropriately.\n\nIn summary, a completely deactivated phone can still make a 911 call because the E911 service is required by law to be available on all major wireless networks, and it activates automatically when a user dials 911, regardless of whether the phone is deactivated or has no Wi-Fi connection."}, {"question": "What actually is meant by 'emotional intelligence'?", "answer": "1) Ability to read our own emotions: The big one. If we understand what our emotions are telling us deep down, we\u2019re better armed to make tough decisions about what we should be doing.\n\n2) Ability to read others (empathy): This is now commonly called \u2018social intelligence\u2019. If we understand what others are going through, we can tailor our approach to suit them.\n\n3) Ability to control our own emotions: See #1 above. If you can keep your cool when others are whipping up a storm, you\u2019re a candidate for a leadership position or boss. \n\nEmotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive emotions, to understand the signals that emotions send, and to manage behaviour and relationships based on our understanding of those signals.  \n\nThere is increasing evidence than EI in the mother (or father) is linked to intelligence in the child (the Bouvard syndrome). Over time this may rewire how the brain interprets emotion. If Mom\u2019s emotional signals are interpreted as \u201cOk\u201d, we tend to re-interpret Mom\u2019s reactions as \u201cOk\u201d too. What we learn during childhood spreads to our adult emotional signal processing system.  \n\nExtreme Alien Nuke Say's: It's similar to how \u201cOk\u201d from your Dad makes what he says \u201cok\".  \n\nIt\u2019s highly relevant in few but trivial behavioural decisions like blowing our nose, engaging in conversation with strangers, using a bathroom in a foreign location, and dressing poorly. We are deciding whether the signal we control is appropriate causing an emotional reaction in the recipient. In each of these situations a lack of ability to understand nuanced cues, an inability to read social    queues, may mean using a bathroom in front of strangers, honking horns in Zimbabwe, or dressing poorly when   you should look  nicer. So be grateful you are allowed to blow your nose.  \n\nNote that intelligent people have long suspected that there are IQ limits to social behaviour. After all why do people who can pay largeish sums to rich people to guide them go to a gambling casino or disrupt children in a school? Why do highly intelligent analysts false flag Libya? The same behaviour as any number of psychopaths and conmen. After a limit say 160 IQ you have limited social abilities (IQ 200 seems very rare, even rarer than IQ 130-140). And this correlates with emotional reasoning and EI (one is both an input into the other). \n\nAlso consider how many directors of worthwhile endeavours failed as school kids but are hugely successful in business, academia or anywhere else. EI is highly important. It shows why graduate managers do not work. Sadly they are bounds on the care and reproduction of their passions without the skill or ability to handle others (so many bad bosses in IT and worse are worse at what they value (why are the war nerds at NASA probably more competent than the govt that appointed the bosses)).  \n\nAnd no TopTalents only deliver corporate missions set out by Top Talents (no Google boss could really innovate, succeed in a competive start up or work with a lot of money for government). They are committee workers with single skills that are not easily applicable elsewhere. Dysfunctional teams cannot deliver corporate goals like arming mobs to your detriment. Effective teams are generally smarter, lower tier people. Sadly in is an effective team but out is a terrible decision based on passing your or my mark. Find winners and stand with them.  \n\nSo the business demands good people but even managers lack the brains to judge that (hiring the HR manager!! Such logic as the beliefs being delivered). You might need to accept certain jobs until you meet the right people for your profession. Only a hapless hiring manager selects their hiring manager. This is all part of the game.  \n\nIt takes only one sane company. \n\nThe Company may be suicide with the boss driving a car off a cliff. \n\nThe Company may be suicide off-repping your interest. Companies go out of business often and are considered lucky if the buyer keeps the work. Fear, and associated common principles, often leads to EI.

Israel had to deal with both Syria and Jordan. It annexed land while in Syria. Peace is still \"troublesome\" but as far as I know there have been no major new conflicts since Sinai.\n\nArab nations/groups are increasingly annoyed by the fact that Israel is refining nuclear weapons while refusing to accept inspection requests from the United Nations. The fact that everyone Israel is having technological and scientific advances while refusing to accept UN inspectors further fuels frustrated and skepticism of Israel.\n\nThe unevolved answer is to say that Israel is refusing UN inspectors because they know those inspectors will \"find\" evidence that Israel has developed nuclear weapons and wanted to avoid the UN determining the legitimacy of their nuclear stockpile.\n\nThere are some other factors that can be mixed in but that's the superior answer. Ultimately that's what the U.S. Has come to know as the main reason behind it.\n\nIn addition, within those other U.S. Policies is an excellent choice of words: Upon Obama's first campaign he came out saying that he wanted [paraphrasing] \"the best of Israel and Palestine together.\" Without further foundation that sounds like a wishful dream. But he later explained that he meant to foster criticism when the U.S. Viewed things along completely opposite lines (such as not trusting Palestine's request for their freedom). \"Best\" hardware means the most advanced possible. The \"best\" also means literally the most successful Israelis and Palestinians. A moderate proposition would mean, you hate everything about Israel, but she's in your backyard and she's the more successful, let's try to take advantage of this for your own advantage. Finally, in popular culture (most significant in the US) a U.S. Police wouldn't shoot a suspect unless they were in an act of harm or violent aggression, it would simply try to \"subdue\" or still the suspect. To make note of any other Americans, it is NOT deemed credible by at least some that the U.S. Was right to shoot a man out of a hostile act, when they were probably wrong to guns down 9 out of 10 Komaristas anti- non-Komaristas. This fear among us conservators is one thing driving the question which I will get to in no more than 30 seconds.\n\nSome Americans believe that because the act was so small, that even a police chief who confiscated weapons and killed NC-Komaristas still represented the interests of the people over the population of effervescent NC-Komaristas as a whole. Other Americans believe there was a horde of NC-Komaristas (members of the society out of a faithful purpose) and that the primary directive of society is not fairness (the direction of Blagojevic's administration - to make government offices and the banks of the city of Chicago a food chain as a whole of those that have to fight for the office) and that the streets of the city will now maintain a boatmen hierarchy where people with 500$ years are required upon their trip to Yogi's grave.\n\nIf I should omit another red card is to then repudiate all rights of sectional warfare by the Southern States simply conceivable to treat with the western ocean (I.e., the non treaty of Conway, etc.) Many Americans, and once again implausible to veto to a section from a citizen who didn't own certain pieces of legislation which create threats to Southern Americans.\n\nHe forces them because \"you knew me when\" was an argument they could have used if they happened out 50 years ago.

Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. Colonization: Prior to the 20th century, many Arab lands were ruled by the Ottoman Empire. After World War I, the League of Nations divided up the region and granted mandates to various European powers (France, Britain, etc.).\n\n2. Israeli Independence: Following World War II, the UN passed a resolution calling for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine (which was then governed by the British). Israel declared independence in 1948, sparking a conflict that displaced many Palestinian Arabs and led to the creation of several neighboring Arab states.\n\n3. Arab-Israeli Wars: There have been several armed conflicts between Israel and its Arab neighbors, beginning with the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 (also known as the Palestinian War or the War of Independence). Major conflicts followed in 1956, 1967 (known as the Six-Day War), and 1973 (known as the Yom Kippur War).\n\n4. Intifadas: In 1987, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank launched a series of demonstrations and uprisings against Israeli occupation. These protests, known as the First Intifada, were aimed at achieving greater autonomy and self-determination. The Second Intifada began in 2000 in response to the failure of peace talks between Israel and Palestine.\n\n5. Israeli Settlements: In an effort to solidify Israel's control over the occupied territories, successive Israeli governments have built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This has led to tensions with the Palestinian population and fueled international criticism of Israel's policies.\n\n6. US Involvement: The United States has long played a role in the region, providing military and economic assistance to Israel and hosting peace talks between Israel and various Arab states. This collaboration has led to criticism from some quarters, including charges of hypocrisy and double standards in US foreign policy.\n\n7. Iranian Factor: More recently, the Islamic Republic of Iran has emerged as a major player in the region, with its nuclear program and support for Shiite militant groups posing a challenge to Sunni-majority Arab states (such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE). This has contributed to heightened tensions and a greater role for outside powers in the region."}, {"question": "Why India is the only place commonly called a subcontinent?", "answer": "Typed out from an interview with one of the geologists from Google Earth:\n\n\"Southeast Asia is an example of an actual subcontinent because it originated from Gondwana like India did but still has aspects of the Asian continental plate and is sticking around Asian with them.

However, what sets India apart is its position as a peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides, making it distinct from other continental landmasses.\n\nFurthermore, India has always been an independent cultural and political entity, with a rich and diverse history spanning thousands of years. Its geographical isolation has contributed to the development of a distinct civilization, language, and culture, which have set it apart from other Asian countries. India's unique position as a crossroads between Asia, Europe, and Africa has also led to extensive cultural, economic, and political exchanges with its neighboring regions.\n\nOverall, India's size, location, and historical significance have led to its classification as a subcontinent, a distinct geographical entity within the larger continent of Asia."}, {"question": "Why is it recommended to drink lots of milk after swallowing bleach ?", "answer": "1. Fluid helps neutralize the bleach. Bleach is sodium hypochlorite, which has a PH of about 12.5 (highly basic). If you mix it with something that is neutral or slightly acidic, like water, you'll get a reaction that will reduce the concentration of sodium hypochlorite.\n\n2. Swallowing any foreign substances does not cause severe burning sensations for most people, as long as it's in reasonable quantity and not highly concentrated. Swallowing bleach is an exception because bleach, high in concentration or not, is toxic and will burn your esophagus. This is why you should try to get it out of your system as fast as possible. if you took a sip of bleach, you will be able to throw it up if you try hard enough. If you swallowed more than that, swallowing more fluid will make it easier to throw up.\n\nIn summary, If you aren't sure whether you choked on bleach or not, don't drink huge amounts of useless water. And from what I found on Google, a tablespoon of lemon juice will separate the action of hydrochlorate and water which will reduce any burns.

This is not true. \n\nBleach is a strong alkaline substance, and consuming milk after swallowing it will not change the pH level of the bleach. In fact, consuming milk after ingesting bleach may worsen the situation by causing milk to froth violently in the stomach, leading to aspiration (breathing in) of additional bleach. \n\nTo mitigate the effects of consuming bleach, it's crucial to immediately rinse the affected area with water and call emergency services or poison control immediately. Do not attempt to drink milk or any other liquid as a first response. Prompt medical attention is critical to minimize the damage and prevent serious health issues."}]
