[{"question": "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for us you would be speaking German\u201d was a common phrase when i was growing up. Has there actually been cases of national language change following the invasion of a sovereign nation?", "answer": "I think the most relevant example of the kind of forced policy being discussed here was the post Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s.  As part of a deliberate policy of pacification, the Soviet regime endeavoured to promote the use of Afghanistan's 'official' language of Dari (which most Afghanis are bilingual in, or indeed speak instead of Pashto) to the expense of Pashto which, post soviet invasion, is practically extinct in the Northern and Central Pashto speaking regions that were occupied by the Soviets.  You can get some a sense of how this worked from George Tibbetts' An Uzbek and a Turk*, who is writing from the perspective of an Uzbek (Dari) taught to write in Russian, and those who fled the North that saw the emergence of states in Afghanistan during the Cold War, such as Maiwada Neko with whom he works.", "baseline_answer": "Yes, there have been several cases of national language change following the invasion of a sovereign nation. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. German occupation of Poland (1939-1945): During World War II, Germany invaded and occupied Poland. The Germans imposed their language on the population, including mandatory German language lessons in schools and the use of German as the official language in government. After the war, Poland regained its independence, but the German influence on the Polish language remained, and many Polish words of German origin have since become a part of the Polish lexicon.\n\n2. Russian occupation of Ukraine (17th century-present): Russia has invaded and occupied Ukraine several times in history, and during those times, the Russian language was imposed on the Ukrainian population. In the late 19th century, as part of a Russification policy, the Russian government banned the use of Ukrainian in public life, and education and government were conducted in Russian. This policy was reversed during Soviet times, when Ukrainian was officially recognized as a State language, but the Russian language still holds significant influence in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern and southern regions.\n\n3. British occupation of India (19th century-1947): Britain colonized India in the 19th century, and as part of its imperial policy,English was imposed on the Indian population. English became the language of government, education, and commerce, and it remains an official language of India today, along with Hindi and several other regional languages.\n\nOverall, the long-term effect of language imposition on a population's national identity and cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and it can vary widely from case to case. Some people see it as a way to spread a superior culture, while others view it as a form of cultural colonization and oppression. Ultimately, the Language Imperialism concept, defined by L UI Valdes, can lead to political and economic consequences, including persisting biases in favor or against that language, favoritism for speakers of 'imperial' linguas prevailing in key sectors as well as in the education system, and enduring rivalries between native and imperial languages in technical spheres at some expense to the latter's purist rectitude."}, {"question": "Why did Russia never heavily invest in colonizing Alaska, and other parts of western North America?", "answer": "In short, Russians did try to colonize Alaska, with mixed results.\n\nMuch earlier than America, the Russian Empire was founded by...a Norseman. Nothing oints this national imperial origin more than the story of a blonde, blue-eyed lad from Norway - who we know as Rurik, but was know by many names, including Kharekh and Haring, and had Norse and Germanic names in other retellings.\n\nRurik is supposed to have landed in Novgorod in 862 CE; he was soon to be some kind of powerful ruler, but his welcoming invitation was not quite specified. He wasn't necessarily made monarch of Novgorod either - storybooks traditionally grant him that role after he unified princes of neighboring areas into accepting him as non-interfering overlord with supreme judiciary to the lower dykes below him. This is the Russian chronicles story, however. Starting with 1443 the Grand Prince was supreme federal authority, and perhaps navigation skill / sailing wandering / maraude of Vikings were enough to bring Rurik and his lineage supreme rule in Slavic and Baltic region of the Baltic Sea overlooking Germany, today's Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lower-Russia (roughly in the west and Rawland and up the Baltic, where they had fabulous trade ports - shallow, guarded bays, profitable for Eastern Europe gold, Amber, Sable skin, and furs, bones or hides  nearby as well.\n\nPerhaps rather unsurprisingly Rurik wasn't certain his superior lineage would allow to secure the fruits of Russian Empire for all the risks his parents and relatives had taken. The house of Rurik became a client of uncouth khazars, so he could concentrate in more economic render, and his decrees gave generations of avarice to his non-Russian servants in the border territories envying the control over of gold and silk caravans, where his Dukes were enough. The New Norse Persians were too maleflexible for the Salian Franks. \n\nPsychologically a Peaceful Princess would only take care of border politics, and maximize diversions rather than squeezing abducted slaves on the holding lands on their norwegian scale, instead. Safe surface storms could be used for economic trade. Their good relations with lower finance powerhouses of Western Europe should only happen with proper security of finance and security against pretenders, which avarice fearful castes make ready. (The Norsemen/Danes/Christian Saxon/Baltics all did that). Consistently kept a sufficient sphere of undue power as quick as they became independent outsider of the duke's good mercenary chain. Isolation of Rurik did allow pirate profits, as well. An average Whatever Vikings couldn't grab too quickly relative to their own locale was too cautious to so easily invest in the Khan's empire. Even marauders were more secure, and he kept ancient treasures, contrast to long-term membership in antiquity politics and eastern eurasianship.\n\nReading that Baltic Vikings had fed themselves and he had done better! Russian rulers were told they would never just enjoy, working like peasants and fools. Border rulers, well at least, unleashed slaves young to death and often as tokens. Over several hundred miles Souto-Eastern border area did get lots of Asian loot, power tokens, treasury and resources to boast him about, in his reign. There is, gone to waste.

Alaska was just a stepping stone in their quest to reach Asia. They didn't have any particular interest in colonizing western North America.\n\n2. Russia's resources were limited. They were already spread thin across their vast empire, including in Siberia, where living conditions were harsh. Colonizing and defending Alaska would've been a significant economic burden for them.\n\n3. The indigenous peoples (Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, etc.) were a formidable challenge.

The cold and damp weather, combined with rugged terrain, made it a hostile environment for any would-be colonizers.\n\nIn summary, Russia's preoccupation with Asia, lack of resources, strong indigenous peoples, lesser value in resources, and extreme weather discouraged them from investing heavily in colonizing Alaska and the broader western North America."}, {"question": "Did the Polish/Lithuanian Winged Hussars wear their \"wings\" in battle? What was the origin of them?", "answer": "**In summary:** Winged helmets weren't worn, and the wings themselves weren't reliable protection. They were a unique way for the Polish-Lithuanian forces to establish themselves as elite during campaigns.\n\n**The wings:** Start with Gustav II Adolf Swedish king's era (1611-1632). A new cavalry formation, the Winged Hussar, was created as part of the Swedish forces. They were created as a perfect combination of shock and movement speed. Part of the move was to frighten their enemy by day and blend in by night, taking part in reconnaissance also. Due to the new formation (also the winged part), the hussars made a very spectacular appearance as well. Feathers & wings were a critical 'costume' part of their image. The wings weren't functional protection and were purely for fantasy/style only.\n\n**Lionhelmets** are an example of slightly earlier weapon costumes, and also the only kind of helmet to exist in which there might be some connection to Gustav II Adolf. Earlier in 1601 the lion piece could be found at the helmet above, and is essential to understand the development of the SWINGED HELMETS USED BY THE POLISH-LITHUANIAN ARMY.\n\nIn 1610, he first had an ornate helmet constructed with lion figure on the brow piece. That 'lion hat' would gather quite the sympathies and was considered central part of its power. The Lancers used in modern times take it from this type. Still, it was highly fantastical and didn't offer any real protection; it was just for bluff. \n\nThe Gustavian era Winged Hussars used the weapons costume, a headdress with an ornate helmet - the 'unpropelled' winged costume and ample convenience. However, from the early 1620s, winged hats weren't part of the costumes. So it seems to have been another Swedish production innovation, so at that stage it's apparently a Status and Symbol than any practical use. It seems the wars were within the Swedish area of control over a more extended period of time when appearance became a sign of superior heavy artillery performances in the 17th century.\n\nIn fact, it is very likely that one of the lancer costumes would have been designed by Swedish masters for the Poles to make the fighters more popular in their lands.\n\nThe style of costume gradually worked its way into everyday life, and it can be seen that in Hussar formations, they were as popular in such groups until the early 19th century. By the close of the 17th century Hussars played a critical role in the light cavalry of several armies. Sweden lost its army about 60 years after Gustav II Adolf's demise at the battle of N\u00e4rke. So of course, the Winged Hussars would come into the POLISH-LITHUANIAN wars started by King Jan III Sobieski in 1674.\n\nThe Hussars served in the army of King John III Sobieski during the Thirteen Years' War (1654-60). Nevertheless, they don't adopt the Symbol. As for the new conquest, they used their representative costume weekly. When their general determined, a barrel appeared after the drive of the attack. The army was equipped on the wings, and the company got to hear the Battles 'Finish Hymn.'Naturally, the Society was considered the defenders, and you should be mentally prepared. Prepare for any consequence in the Warsaw Bull Herald solely escorting the bustle feature to leave the audience open for region warfare. In Ukraine, Poland and Kingdom of Hungary/ Hungary.\n\nThe costumes themselves have significance: Spielberg (Indiana Jones) has had some series of Cavaliers Hussars in their dressing for captains or officers in generally uniform dress background in the movie \"Last Crusade,\" that is, later. The plot is part of the Slavic region of the 17th century king Johan III Sobieski scenario evocatively somewhat related with Rio Grande film trend 'live with the Indian or with whites chiefs' (Wheeler & Robert E. Kirch! 2015).\n\nIn the image that figured, the soldier seen without a helmet or cap would have had a cap which was lost, with a large slope on", "baseline_answer": "Yes, the Polish/Lithuanian Winged Hussars did wear their distinctive wings, known as kopiorki, in battle. These wings were not functional, but instead represented the hussars' wings of an angel or hero in Slavic mythology. They were also a symbol of Polish-Lithuanian unity and really unique regalia, as the Winged Hussars were the only European cavalry regiment to wear such wings.\n\nThe wings were made of either leather or quills and were attached to the hussars' helmets or caps, as well as their horse's bridles. They appeared heavily decorated with gold, silver, and feathers.\n\nThe origin of these wings dates back to the 17th century when Poland-Lithuania faced several wars, and the country's Crown Hetman, Jan Sobieski, adopted the idea from Hungary as a way to distinguish his cavalry regiment. The wings caught the imagination of the whole nobility, and soon enough, the Winged Hussars became iconic symbols of Polish-Lithuanian military valor, which they retained until WWII.\n\nThe same idea of wings was also evident in other European Militaries, especially in Austria, Hungary, and Sweden. However, only the Winged Hussars held on to this tradition with full allegiance, and it is a proud attribute of the Polish cavalry still today."}, {"question": "In the United States during the time of slavery did anyone argue that the use of slaves eliminated jobs that other wise would have been done by free citizens.", "answer": "Question: In the United States during the time of slavery did anyone argue that the use of slaves eliminated jobs that other wise would have been done by free citizens.??\nAnswer: There was a long running point of argument over whether abolition would benefit the laboring class, and address economic inequality. The basic idea was:\n\n1) Abolition would free you from having to subsidize slave owners (whom they argued were not actually productive)\n    a. Lower labor costs because slave labor was inherently cheaper\n    b. Lower cost of goods since as a result you could pay higher wages to the poor and reduce reliance on slave goods (although some then argue that prices will increase due to a decrease in supply)\n    c. And/or end the cycle of using \"cheap\" slave production to pricing out American labor (Lewis Tappan seems very much in favor of this idea)\n\n2) More free labor would mean increased competition, bringing prices for labor and goods lower.\n\n3) Land would be freed for free farmers, giving increased land per family, as well as another land flow (feel free to label this argument as a prejudice against the \"Negro\")\n\n4) Finally laboring class could \"productively engage in production and accumulation, for themselves\" (preferably as landowners; as ironic as that sounds, it represented a great deal of freedom at the time).\n\nThis argument is expanded in Tappan (calif. Union, 1848)\n\nUltimately, this has nearly nothing to do with *you*, or the current advantages of owning a slave. But, rather issues related to the consolidation of laboring class freedoms, and the process of doing away with vast holdings on small farms.", "baseline_answer": "Yes, some people in the United States argued that the use of slaves eliminated jobs that otherwise would have been done by free citizens. \n\nThis argument was known as the \" performed labor theory\" and was often used by proponents of slavery to defend the institution.  According to this theory, if slaves were not used to cultivate crops and perform other manual labor, then free white labor would be required to do that work, which would drive up the cost of living and make it more difficult for white people to make a living.  The theory suggested that slavery helped to maintain a lower cost of living for white people by supplying cheap labor to do tasks that would otherwise need to be done by paid white labor.\n\nHowever, critics of slavery pointed out that the argument was flawed for several reasons.  First, they argued that the peformed labor theory failed to take into account the fact that many slave owners were wealthy and did not perform manual labor themselves.  Since slaves did not compete with free white labor in the same way that they would have if they were emancipated, the theory suggested that white laborers had nothing to fear from the existence of slavery.  Moreover, critics pointed out that many tasks that were assigned to slaves could be performed by machines or by free white laborers who were willing to work for lower wages, thus undermining the argument that slavery was necessary to provide cheap labor for white people.\n\nIn short, while some people in the United States argued that the use of slaves eliminated jobs that would have been done by free citizens, this argument was not widely accepted and was ultimately discredited by critics of slavery."}, {"question": "Why were the Romans so fervent on exterminating Christians, yet they were tolerant towards other religions in the empire?", "answer": "There is a lot here worth answering.\n\n1. The short answer is that the Roman Empire had a long and complicated history. The decision of the Roman authorities to be severe on Christians, often to the point of granting them the status of hostis publicus, an enemy of the people, cannot fairly be compared to a decided policy like Alexander's homicide of the sectaries in Egypt, Augustus' grave insults to Ares and Isis, or then latter prophetic legations' notorious orders that commanded all the Roman citizens living in the region to live burning everything to thread and all sex to homosexuality (2 Samuel 12.26-31). This is not to say that the Empire did not have policies that could reference falsely religious claims (the 2nd and 3rd centuries are noteworthy for the extent to which Christian and Roman religious historiography employed forged documents to discredit their rival's religion, especially in Gaul).\n\n2. The initial persecutions of Christians are tied up with Nero's paranoia. The fire of Rome in 64 AD, thinly rationalized as the Christians' fault, created one of the most personal crises of the Flavian dynasty. Whilst Nero's own suicide in late June 68 gave a critical pause to a litany of significant reforms instituted within the principate, this airport story was considered (like many of the other contemporary explanations) a distraction. When he was still alive, the new law that criminalized messianic and homicidal and perverted religions to a new level of shame with a variable severe punishment across Syria and in the south.\n\n3. In order to convince people that these matters of deep political significance, the Senate composes the *Gesta Civis Deorum invictorum* in 334, strongly condemning these new sects, helping Nero heighten and exacerbate them to the point of the infamous fire of Rome. Defining the functions of coercion, this legal socialization of the Flavian dynasty will become a paradigm for criminalizing early demand by the emperor for the *Naassene* sect or ban on puberty in the next century. This age's specific inclination gesture is even more formally expressed in the Domus Aurea, which severely bridled communication between the principate and the rest of civitas (in which becomes sharply defined). In conjuncture with this exercise of construction, the Christians will be asked to appear in sight in their group of *vermin* (that is Saturn) and homogenized to the most hostile group that contrasted the early Flavians.\n\n4. It is common to see recently Christianized or universally pagan asynchronous texts condemned, or with the insinuation. In the Republican period the differentional legislative collection (notably the XII Tablule of the Laws) emphasized its distinction from the gentes, which went beyond religion to the performance of the social structure. This stigma remains in force during the Roman period. The Baet Brown (symbol permitted in Hughes' treaty) decrees repeatedly suggest that the urban period of social frustration is in contrast to the traditional local community. The *Antiqua Romanis badius* and *Christi Mansuetes loci delictosque sui prima reprehensio* in consumer rights guarantee to accommodate specific enmities, directing the accused to helldogs or dogs. The choice is, in fact, arbitrary, but indicates a legal environment that felt religious.\n\nSOURCES: Susanna Elm, *Alexander the False Prophet: Gnostics and Roman Empire* (Columbia University 2013), 57-95; Suzanne Dixon, *Women of Rome* (Routledge, 2011), 1-15; Jessica Rego, \"Legal Means and Legal Action in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia,\" *Journal of Popular Romance Studies* 6 (2014): 90-99; Peter Brown, \"The Law and the Church at Rome\" (trans.: Dale B.

This is known as the principle of \"cultus coerced,\" which allowed individual religious practices as long as they did not disturb the broader social order.\n\nChristianity, on the other hand, was different. First, its monotheistic nature posed a direct threat to the traditional polytheistic religion of the Roman Empire. Christians worshipped one god and disavowed traditional Roman deities. Second, Christians refused to recognize the authority of either the emperor or the traditional Roman priesthood. As a result, the Christian religion was seen as a subversive force by the Roman authorities, who feared that its teachings could undermine the sanctioned religious order and political authority.\n\nThis fear and intolerance led to ongoing persecution of Christians during the first several centuries of the Roman Empire. While non-Christian religions were generally permitted to practice their faiths, Christianity was frequently subjected to legal penalties, social ostracism, and occasional violent attacks.\n\nIn summary, the Romans were fervent in exterminating Christians because they saw them as a serious threat to traditional religious and political authority, while they tolerated other religions that did not pose such a challenge."}, {"question": "How did the early USSR handle classic Russian literature?", "answer": "At first, there were basically two stances on how to treat classic Russian literature, which mostly faded away over time, with Stalin's regime having the final word in the matter. \n\nMany of the more populist/democratic inspired leaders found classic literature to be a source of social criticism that could propagandize rather decent results considering the far-from republican censorship imposed on the regime at the time.\n\nThe most prominent example of Fuhrer's timing of using such literature occurred in the 1920s when Georgi Pleasev aroused broad public attention, making Chekhov's plays as popular as canonical war films in modern cinema. Later in the early 30s the regime started to push initiatives toward valuing certain traditions, in a country shocked by wars from revolution to civil warsPlus the threat of the Nazis was coming, you could say that the regime wanted ideologically oriented Russian literature too.\n\nThat said, look at the second answer of this Reddit post in reaction to the Soviet Stalinist interpretation of the Russian famous author Leo Tolstoy. This response pinpoints not only the political aspect but also what Poesie is made of, and how the Bolsheviks fought against the first on the one hand, the second on the other and have been to this day.\n\nThe regime tried to place this sanitization-staking more towards novels since the perceived popular successes were at this time difficult to have under a central production plan, despite the regime's own efforts in the Marxist-Leninist tradition outside artworks. The first major breakthrough was when the US-Soviet skills expert of the 90s merged in his last book \"The Hemingway in Russia\" the foundation of typical US scholars in Tolstoy, a copy of *Resurrection* (fit on the party line, with a few pages-change results) and the strictly Marxist version of *War and Peace* to get some aspect of social realism. True, the USSR did not officially approve this book and the author, W.B. Leeman, did not dare write the same about a Russian author. In the early years after the Revolution, Russian-American critic Moura Budberg was president of the publishing committee of the famous socialist publisher George Allen & Unwin, which had translated Tolstoy's *Resurrection*. This translation was praised by Budberg, though she also found fault with the quality of the Russian; this marked Tolstoy, a more orthodox man than Chekhov, was too far from her style.", "baseline_answer": "The early Soviet Union placed a significant emphasis on classic Russian literature as a means of strengthening Soviet national identity and promoting socialist ideology. The Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 had dismantled the Tsarist regime, which had played a significant role in promoting Russian literary figures. The new Soviet government sought to fill this void by elevating writers who expressed socialist ideals, such as Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nGorky, in particular, played a notable role in spreading Marxist-Leninist thought through literature. He advocated for Soviet literature to be not just a means of artistic expression but also a political tool for communist indoctrination. Gorky encouraged Soviet writers to depict the Soviet workers' struggle for equality and social justice, as exemplified in his works \"Mother\" (1906) and \"The Lower Depths\" (1902).\n\nThe early Soviet state recognized the cultural value of classic Russian literature from the Tsarist period and adopted it as a means of preserving Russian cultural heritage while promoting Soviet ideology. However, the Soviet government also used literary censorship to control and manipulate content to suit their ideological agenda. For example, Vladimir Nabokov's novel \"Lolita\" was banned in the Soviet Union due to its sexual themes, which were deemed counter-revolutionary.\n\nDespite this, Soviet literary output continued to showcase classic Russian literary forms such as the novel, in contrast to the avant-garde movements embraced by Western modernists. The Soviet state continued to encourage and promote classic Russian literary traditions, and Soviet writers continued to draw inspiration from those traditions while incorporating socialist themes.\n\nIn conclusion, the early Soviet Union's relationship with classic Russian literature was a complex one, characterized by a balance between preserving traditional forms and promoting socialist ideology. While censorship and manipulation occurred, classic Russian literature remained an essential part of Soviet culture, providing a foundation for Soviet literature and contributing to the construction of a distinct Soviet cultural heritage."}, {"question": "There are several famous examples of Stalin's regime altering pictures, such as Stalin walking next to the Moscow canal, where Yezhov was replaced with...more canal. Why would one picture be this significant? What made doctoring these images the preferred course of action?", "answer": "As the cultural historian John E. Bowlt has suggested, Stalin was also given to creating alternate realities. Bowlt says in his work, *Soviet-Type Totalitarianism, Stalinism as a World Model*, that Stalin did not have a firm grasp of how to run the country. Instead, he sort of winged it, making decisions based on his intuition rather than careful planning. In order to portray himself as a successful leader unrivaled in wisdom and planning, he deliberately created an alternate reality. \n\nStalin had a strong belief in the power of symbols, and memorably once remarked about the importance to Soviet democracy of giving a new name to a street. Thus any opportunity to substitute a newer, better image or symbol for an inferior one was worth pursuing. After all, he felt that symbolism drove almost every other aspect of Soviet life, why not use it as a political tool? Pretty much, Stalin saw the Police State as a kind of *tableau vivant*. Create a vision and it will become reality.\n\nStalin apparently screened all public newsreels and photographs, and any that failed to meet his standards he ordered re-shot or defaced. As George Orwell noted in his book *1984*, if Stalin wanted a photograph \"changed, it was changed. [...] If (Stalin) did not like a picture by a certain artist, then he commissioned a new one [...] No picture was of such intrinsic value to him that it could not be burnt, pulped, mutilated, smashed, shut up in a cupboard, flung down the lavatory inconvenient [...] If you lost your job at the Institute of World Literature, every work ever written during your employment was instantly condemned and vanished\". \n\nIn a way, Stalin seems to have forgotten one of his own more resonant Stalin-isms, \"It is impossible to force the basis of a social system on the superstructure.\" According to Soviet scholar Stephen Kotkin, Stalin erred in this regard by defining social reality through Soviet symbolism rather than modifying the symbolism to correspond to actual Soviet realities. \n\nUsing Stalin's criticisms of  Martin Lutsher Bizet's opera *Carmen* as an example, Kotkin writes, \"The manual for the transformation of physical and visual renditions of remembered (and invented) reality into the miracle of life - the Soviet motto of transformation was utured (not just by Bukharin and Stalin but also, in the 1920s, by Stalin - himself a poet and ardent advocate of the poetry experiments of the time) - fit very well into the broader belief of the period.\n\n'Artistic leaders - says Bizet meant in Russia - should create the basis of life within themselves and outside themselves, then transform themselves into the centers of vital forces which have been created and then try to realize old life [*stare zhizn*] within themselves and outside themselves.\n\nThis formulaic statement is particularly remarkable if one looks at its situational context as a characterization of Sovietization in all spheres. Here, Stalin is articulating anaving anguished and in the upheaval of this moment there is a clean slate, within themselves and outside [*v sebe i vokrug sebya*]\". 1\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, when Stalin tried to force the transformation of social reality through symbols, one could say he got anguished results. Then again, the Soviet leaders of that time were quite simply ill-prepared for the task. \n\nSources: Kotkin, *Magnetic Mountain*, especially pp. 9-17.\n\n^* Kotkin's work is almost endless and contains a lot of great tales - I highly recommend his books!\n\n^** Vladimir Slepakov, one of Russia's most prominent POETS, recently opined that Stalin ineffectiviness at art lay not in his artistic sterility, but in his lack of wit - and this sense of wit, or humor, is that cemented, he says again for the student reading, in socialist modernism, in which all imagination flows from out themselves, a trait common in poets from Bukharin to Tsvetayeva. \"For this reason, Stalin would have to be my 'inclined predecessor, perpetuating scientific and clear statement from a developed state,", "baseline_answer": "Stalin's regime altered pictures because they were a powerful tool for shaping public opinion and promoting the cult of personality around Stalin. By doctoring images, the Soviet government could create a more favorable visual representation of reality that aligned with their ideological goals and political agenda. In the case of Stalin walking next to the Moscow canal, Yezhov was replaced with more canal because Yezhov had been purged from the government, and removing him from the photograph reflected the regime's desire to erase his memory and eliminate any association between him and Stalin. By replacing Yezhov with more water, the regime could portray Stalin as more connected to the region's engineering projects and reinforce the image of him as an all-powerful leader. In short, doctored images served as a means of controlling the narratives and manipulating the perceptions of the public, and they helped to bolster the regime's hold over society."}, {"question": "How was Prussian history seen in Germany after unification?Was it appropriated by the rest of Germany?", "answer": "1.

Over 25,000 heavy bombers were lost during War, being the most bombers ever lost in any war (2nd place being the US during the Vietnam war with 5000.). In todays perspective Soviet Union was still a developing country at that time and the resources and influence by aircraft design contributed to the total 25,000 on the Russian side. \n\n* When WW2 ended, obviously a larger part of the air force was dedicated to supporting the military in general instead of bombing ground troops from above. \n\n* By 1949 the total amount of U.S. Nuclear missiles was able to overcome an estimated 63 million lives (as of 2000) of the Russian/Soviet population. The U.S. Could potentially decimate the population a factor of 10 higher. \n\n* Due to a couple detente\u2019s in the early 50s between Russian and the U.S., both societies were able to disarm tactical weapons (Tactical being \u201ca given event within wingspan and altitude of an bomber equipped with our own type of weapons\u201d). A U.S. B-17 bomber had on 580 million Free Fall Nuclear Bombs \"F.F. NB\". Each bomb had a total blast effect of 4 tons of TNT, 4 tons per square foot and 8 tons per cubic foot. The new concept came to throwing the same ground units into one bomb which meant the B-17 now had 8,400 tons of this substance and 32,000 tons of this cubic substance inside just one aircraft. If Sovietistan and USA just dropped a few of these nuke bombs on full Russian population, the blast your mortal frame butts against would tighten the atmosphere in the blast radius up to 9 times. \n\n* Russia stayed under in terms of power after the war due to a huge famine occuring from October/November 1950 and on. There was, as you should know, dozens of nuclear missiles between Patriot IM, R-10, R-12, R-13, etc. And the first order of business as to modernize these missiles and airframes. There was an ambitious radar integrated homing, which happens right now on all Russia planes but first of all electronic the development was completely erased. The engineers kept referring back to J-35 project, they tried adopting the electronic for vectoring but also cancelled that project. They used the same \u201csacrificing\u201d methods on the recon planes by taking them off as large platforms with many modifications (relevance based on the end of war) except when modifying for atomic missiles. Only in the 70s did they modify this plane with an internal radar (R-35) having a very small rate of success. \n\n* Motherland used completely B-17 class Soviets during the war on the ground. It was R-25 which was delivered to some airports outside of USSR few years after WW2. The R-25 was a clean sheet design and it weighed 94,000kg though they didn\u2019t had that much mileage/endurance. The R-25 did have capabilities for finding targets, a few R-25s were kept in some nearby metropolitan areas to protect for immediate attack.\n\n* The R-25 did get some modifications but the incendiary bomb was one of the first components of the weapon systems. Coal smoke, petroleum positive and chemical positive and thermal energy were the first few modifications of the radar which in this time meant more accuracy as the resolution for radars was initially lower. The Soviet Union used an area type (radar electronic acts on a certain area and explodes when bomb hits the area you wished to show ground/target) rather than a guided rocket.  \n\n\n* The engineer who invented the R-25 was not the same one who also designed the R-25's bomb / rocket. His name was Pavlov, he is the reason why the Engineering University in Moscow is called \"A. Pavlov\". He started designing during the war years, used complex aerodynamics to keep up the limited costs of the Soviet platforms. When he designed the wing of the plane, he casted it as", "baseline_answer": "During the Cold War, while the Russians were certainly capable of designing and producing top-quality fighter aircraft, they struggled with bomber design for several reasons:\n\n1. Priority: The Soviet Union placed a much higher priority on developing its fighter planes over its bombers. This was due in part to the perceived threat from NATO's airpower, which required a strong fighter force to nullify the impact of strategic bombers. As a result, more resources and expertise went into fighter design, leaving less for bomber development.\n\n2. Limited research and development: The Soviet Union lacked the same level of resources and technology available to the United States in terms of research and development of new aircraft designs. This put a significant burden on engineers trying to create advanced bomber technology using outdated tools and know-how.\n\n3. Shortages: The Soviet economy was in a constant state of crisis during the Cold War, resulting in shortages of essential materials such as aircraft aluminum alloys and advanced computer systems that were required for high-tech avionics development. This made it difficult to produce advanced bombers, as engineers had to rely on less advanced components to make do.\n\n4. Emphasis on stealth: As the Cold War progressed, the Soviet Union became increasingly focused on developing stealth technologies to counteract the threat of American bombers. However, the resources required to develop effective stealth technology stretched the capabilities of the Soviet aviation industry, leaving little room for further development of existing bomber designs.\n\nIt wasn't until the end of the Cold War that the Russian bomber program began to flourish with the development of the modern Tupolev Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bomber fleets. Nonetheless, it's clear that the lack of resources, research, and development opportunities during the Cold War left major gaps in the Soviet bomber program that took many years to overcome."}, {"question": "Are there any other historical instances where a nation gained their independence through voting similar to the Scottish Independence Referendum?", "answer": "I'd say that the best example would be Switzerland in the late 1800s, but there's also a better known example from the 20th century.\n\nSwitzerland did vote in 1848 to join the German Confederation. Soon after, in a series of votes, it voted to dissolve that Confederation, adopt a Neutrality Act, form a Federal meeting, and then dissolve it again to form a Federation instead. Switzerland is a federal country, so a Federal meeting would have been Parliamentary sessions, and this broke up the Confederation in much the same way that Canada previously broke up the original British confederation we've written about in some older posts in this subreddit. \n\nAll of that - the hosting of the votes, the voting for the end of the Confederation, a neutrality act, forming a Parliament, and then a federation instead - happened within about two years. It was highly unusual, especially the fact that I'm calling two Kingless Parliaments in two years as highly unusual. Really, I think the two parliaments are probably enough to write about, and the Parliament which ended the Confederation was already becoming a de facto national Parliament, with only Switzerland and some breakaway areas left in the Confederation. After the Federation was voted in, there was a constitutional convention whose primary objective was simply to formally form a federal constitution. For the most part, what got voted on during the conventions was how many cantons (federal states) there were going to be. \n\nThe Confederation period was one of sickly political vivacity, where there were many coups, votes, and extensive corruption. Switzerland *continues* suffering from a serious political instability as it keeps having three main political sides. In 1840, the Credit Suisse Agora-Lombard Liberalt center-right attempted to kidnap the British ambassador. In 1888, less than a week after voting to join the German Confederation, Artur Gross and his friends killed three Liberty and Progress Party members (He simply liked shooting police officers. Got what was coming to him).\n\nSo in 1848, Switzerland already had a history of hyperextended instability.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also want to chat briefly about some qualifications - I haven't included:\n\n- Belgium - 1830 was before the creation of a bunch of *other* referendums for independence, and independence for Brussels was never a serious option under Dutch rule.\n\n- United States - probably the poster-child of a (violent/armed) country gaining independence through voting, but I've talked about it before in reply to this question. It's not 'not' democratic, but the idea that all of 56 governments banded together in a situation already pretty volatile and took a vote is fun. Representatives were certainly selected before a vote took place in 1776.\n\n*Edited - Wrote a bunch about Greece, but it wasn't at all transparent about their politics. I've recently had to deal with politics in Ireland and Greece in my schoolwork, and nearly failed again Greece about how often they held elections. So no, although I'm looking for it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe 1991 Slovenian Referendum on Independence is generally held up in examples of popular democracy. There were two things about this referendum which were very good for upholding the democratic legitimacy of independence:\n\n- It was a flat two-sided question: Independence or no independence.\n\n- 94% of registered voters did, in fact, vote. On one side of the aisle, it's unconstitutional in the US to not vote. In Finland in 2012, people physically have been barred from voting. In Slovenia, 98% of the registered population voted.\nUser inspired question: [What happened in this instance, and why did it forget to hold several elections?]([LINK]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter this, some EU countries made moves *just* to veto Slovenia from entry to condemn the country's independence as a result of the referendum.

As recently as 2017, Vera Jourova, the (then) EU's Commissioner for Justice and Consumers, said that nationalists' and anti-global elites' rhetoric didn'", "baseline_answer": "Yes, there have been a few historical instances where a nation gained independence through a referendum or popular vote, similar to the Scottish Independence Referendum:\n1. Ecuadorian Referendum of 1948: In 1948, following a military coup, the National Congress of Ecuador called for a referendum on whether to keep the existing constitution or adopt a new one. The 1948 Ecuadorian Constitution, which recognized social and economic rights, was approved by popular vote.\n\n2. French Algerian Referendums of 1958 and 1961: In 1958, a referendum was held in French Algeria to determine whether it would become an autonomous republic within the French Community or remain as part of France. The No vote (for autonomy) won, and in 1961 a second referendum was held, this time on whether Algeria would remain part of France. The Yes vote (for continued French rule) was defeated, resulting in Algeria gaining independence.\n\n3. Portuguese Referendum of 1974-76: Following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal in 1974, a series of referendums were held in 1974-76. These referendums resulted in the adoption of a new constitution, recognition of political parties, and the granting of autonomy to the Azores and Madeira (two archipelagoes that are part of Portugal), all by popular vote.\n\n4. Montserratian Referendum of 2000: In 2000, the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat held a referendum on whether to become an autonomous part of Antigua and Barbuda. The No vote (for autonomy) won, and Montserrat remains a British Overseas Territory.\n\n5. East Timor Referendum of 1999: The United Nations-sponsored referendum in 1999 resulted in the re-establishment of the independence of East Timor, which had been annexed by Indonesia.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that although referendums and popular votes are not always successful in granting independence, they have been used historically in various parts of the world."}, {"question": "How did Israel develop such an effective military so quickly after its independence?", "answer": "There are a number of things that Israel was able to take advantage of from the very moment of statehood:\n\n1. A small population with a strong cohesion from living in a relatively small area (Britain, in some ways, was the counter to this, with a larger population across a much larger part of the world).  Britain found themselves having to \"fight with one hand tied behind their back\" as they were hugely geographically dispersed. \n\n2. This cohesion meant that people really had something to fight for, which in turn provided or strengthened a sense of volunteerism.  This volunteerism was a HUGE plus for the Jewish state, generating a deep pool of manpower that countries like Iraq and Egypt would lack.  This was very comparable to your typical Southern states versus the Union states in the US Civil War.  In fact, it wasn't so much about inherent capabilities as much as it was about the sheer number of resources and people willing to use those resources for whatever ends the Israeli government told them to use-- worthy of the state's strong militaristic spirit which was used to convice their people, at every stage in Israel's history, that there was always a looming threat.  While Iraq and Egypt probably had better soldiers on a case-by-case basis, the sheer number and passion of Israeli soldiers, as well as the hidden military strategy, proved to be an unbeatable combination.  In the end, I think it was the talks of Egyptian soldiers looking at the sheer numbers of Israeli soldiers and expressing the overwhelming feeling that \"there's just too many of them.\" -- Disclaimer: the second point about volunteerism is something I've never seen in article on the topic, and instead could well be what I like to call, \"a total brain fog\".\n\n3. Nevertheless, Israeli military strategy, and indeed mastery, coupled with the volunteer strategy meant they utterly crushed Arab troops (and later, much of the locals in Gaza and Palestine) in war.  I want to add right now, that I really do not claim to be an expert on the Middle East, and I'm sure other answers will provide a more in depth look at this question, so don't hesitate to leave a response saying that I can add to what's below.  That being said, I believe a good example to show the Israeli military strategy can be seen in the Sinai Campaigns from 1956 (a.k.a. Sinai War, Suez War, or Tripartite Aggression).   The Sinai campaigns saw Israel attempt to occupy the city of Egypt known as Suez City, known today as Ismailia.  This was significant because it sat opposite from the south side of Sinai, essentially defending the borders of Israel and the Strait of Suez. The indirect objective was to get a pledge from Egypt to put its military on standby for future, if any, Israeli incursions on Egyptian territory.   A maximalist's goal for Israel would be stretching further into the Sinai peninsula and ultimately reaching Gaza, ostensibly to defend the Israeli border to the East.  A second reason was to lay a foundation for export to Europe, as the new non-aligned western nations lead the way in declining enthusiasm for tying themselves historically to the British Empire. \n\n\nHowever, claiming Suez city was proven difficult for Israeli interests, and in the late war, Israeli forces rejected advanced offers to negotiate, such as turning control over the city back to the Egyptians and an unspecified number of U.N. Troops.  In turn, after having Negev airfield as a key part of their military, troops retreat East and South-East toward Egypt and Israel respectively, essentially letting Nazareth fend for itself, contributing to the fall of Negev.  Moreover, during the battle what forces they had left in Negev the next day relinquished control to Egyptian troops.  This loss at Suez city was part of a larger loss of men, much of which you can find in the Israeli narrative itself (as it would be seen that Israel never stopped fighting for its land on the East).  Here is a [recap of that battle]([LINK] from CBS news  reported on October 7th, 1956 as the UN started to press Israel for a complete withdrawal.  \n\nDespite that, we can't overlook that the Sinai campaigns involved making Egyptians believe what Israeli forces were complaining about in western texts at the time, and especially today, that their nuclear deterrent would be obliterated in", "baseline_answer": "1. Strategic assistance from former colonial power: Israel received considerable help from its former colonial power, the British. The British Empire had left the region in 1947, but many former British officers and British-trained soldiers from the area continued to have firsthand experience with Israel's geography and neighbors. The British provided Israel with strategic intelligence, mat\u00e9riel, and training during the War of Independence.\n\n2. National Psychology and Ordre Militaire: The drive for independence created a shared national purpose, instilling in Israelis a distinct sense of national brotherhood. Suggested by French historian Edmond Michon, ordre militaire refers to the French hierarchical ordering of ranks. Israel's militant nationalism added an Israeli stream to this French tradition. As Israeli soldiers banded together, they developed an ideology, a specific way of life aimed at giving them a clear and coherent understanding of what they were fighting for. This early but little-known Israeli stream of ordre militaire impacted strategic planning by encouraging the IDF to focus on the root cause of instability rather than just alleviating the problems of the moment.\n\n3. Geographic advantage and mastery of territory: Israel's geographic advantage provided the IDF with a tactical opportunity. Stretching out like a finger from the Middle Eastern coastline, the Suez Canal provided the Israelis with the chance to take control of the entire waterway. Seizing this corridor back in 1956 during the Sinai War gave the IDF decisive tactical control over the region\u2014a pivotal moment for the young country as it established Israel's first line of defense.\n\n4. Mobilizing existing gold-star reserve units led by experienced officers: As part of its fight for independence, Israel had mobilized its \u201cgold star\u201d reserve units\u2014people who served in the former Palmach and Haganah, made up of Old Yishuv, British Army veterans, and pre-state go-getters. They fought in the War of Independence alongside the new regular army. By integrating this powerful mix of elite former Haganah and Palmach soldiers as the backbone of the new Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), the nascent Israel got off to a fast start.\n\n5. Strong US alliance: Following the Suez War in 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower cut off American economic assistance to Israel in response to its unilateral action during the war, bringing Israel\u2019s cash storage to a six-month low. After a brief period of austerity, US-Israel relations improved. With the US cutting defense subsidies in favor of a direct aid approach, Israel started to assume self-sufficiency. US President Harry Truman had recognized the newly formed Israel in 1948, and with the passing of the 1966 Foreign Assistance Act, U.S. Foreign aid to Israel grew significantly.\n\n6. Prioritized research and development: Israel allocated resources early on to research and development, placing a large emphasis on technological advancements later categorized as the \u201cIsraeli Miracle.\u201d The R&D groups fostered during this period included ex-Palmach volunteers and other reservists, who were trained under field conditions and later furnished with rudimentary equipment to create sophisticated weapons systems.\n\n7. Leadership by Yigael Yadin: Yigael Yadin, an outstandingly focused military commander, took on serious leadership challenges. Yadin left his duties as Chief Historian of the Jewish Agency to lead the Haganah in 1948 as it was met with significant obstacles in battle against multiple fronts. His leadership exuded a level of focus and courage that led to the Haganah's transformation from a lightly armed, poorly organized militia into a more organized and disciplined fighting force. Yadin\u2019s focus in the War for Independence became integral toward positioning Israel for victory. The shift in strength encouraged fighters to adopt more innovative tactics, including a flexible strategy that allowed Israeli forces and allied tribes to climb from force to resistance through tenacity and logistical fortitude.\n\n8. Absorbency of input from outside: Responsible for leading foreign relations, Golda Meir recognized that fostering alliances would translate to both diplomatic and military gains. The combination of military assistance and alliances with neighboring countries helped the young Israeli army evolve swiftly. Alliances enabled Israel to learn from the past successes of neighboring countries, consolidating its position in the region.\n\n9.

Israel used the fused technology and fission plutonium they had access to from the Manhattan Project and even reverse engineered some of the U-235 rich trensa that were supposed to destroy the German nuclear program. The straw that broke the camels back was Hafez Al-Assad going on TV and ranting about how he'd make Israelis into falafel. Scared of Egypt, the Israelis considered using their nukes even in the conventional war and Abu Hashish, the Minister of Defense who backstabbed his own career, advised that elderly rockets be launched, one from the sea and one from the ground.\n\nInterestingly enough the Israelis were achieving quite a victory against the Egyptians who were slow and unorganized, the IDF was ready to cut them off. They were worn out, however, and when the Syrians attacked they were seriously conflicted. It was Hafez Al-Assad who blundered into the war spending a third of the GDP in a single night and causing 250,000 Syrian deaths resulting in the gold reserves moving to Uni systems making everything rely on foreign dollars, Golan Heights being useless, and releasing severe poverty further south by the clique he composed, the Baath.\n\nThe situation looked hopeless for Israel. The obvious weapons acquisition from Egypt was completely destroyed in the first wave and Egyptian tanks were moving with an extremely slow speed for their time, antiaircraft technology was open in the sun as the Israeli village Sinai continued to operate on the Western front, and the eastern front was instigated by Saudi Arabian transport of armament and munitions into Syria over river and wheel.\n\nIsrael was eventually crippled by another theft of 200 of the finest tanks, wounded below the midriff which they're refusing to inspect till they're able to strangle the nation down, and disassembly by Hezbollah.

Additionally, Western intelligence agencies monitoring Israeli air force movements observed that their bombers were not actively preparing for a nuclear strike, which further undermined the credibility of such reports. Ultimately, Israel chose to narrowly escape destruction through a combination of limited conventional tactics and strategic reserve forces, rather than resorting to nuclear weapons."}, {"question": "From the about the 1940s, 50s, to present how did the words \"gay\" and \"queer\" went from meaning \"happy\" and \"strange\" to denote homosexual orientation?", "answer": "There's actually an article in The Journal of Homosexuality (Volume 26, Issue 1-2, February 1993) about this by John D\u2019Emilio entitled, \"How We Became Post-Gay: Self-Opposition to Gay and Lesbian Identity\" which you could track down and read if you have access to a library.\n\nTL;DR: The reason history is full of examples of men having male sexual partners long before there was even a word for homosexuality is that through most of Western history, masculine identity was predicated on the idea of having mastery over sexuality, especially over women. This meant the option of sex with other men was not seen as inherently in opposition to male identity so long as it was considered a safe, contained, private affair. Over the centuries various words crept into use describing such intercourse, but often were related to some aspect of degeneracy or disease (either perceived or actual, depending on whether syphilis or other venereal diseases were confused or conflated with homosexuality).\n\nThese sanctions against homosexual activity and expression grew much stronger in the late 19th century, particularly in those Western countries that had been directly impacted by the Protestant Reformation and its heterosexualizing influences (e.g. England, the United States. Denmark and Norway were less impacted by these theological movements). In this historical context, Dutch academic Hendrick Dubbelman, in his recent book *Happy Gentlemen: Homosexuality and its Social Control since 1870* detailed how the Dutch term for homosexual, homoseksualisme, came to be. The Netherlands were a relatively late adopter of homosexuality laws, and operated with a very different approach to homosexual activity when they were in place. There were several case precedents that explain the curious origin.\n\nD\u2019Emilio\u2019s BriefHistory article (heh) isn\u2019t a lengthy treatment, but he highlights five main moments in language usage shifts:\n\n1. In the late 19th century in the United States, the word \u2018queer\u2019 came to be mood-killer spoken to gays in moments like, \u201cYou ain\u2019t queer, are you?\u201d from someone else speaking to a gay man unfortunately mistaken for effeminate henpeckered husband. It became a way to express resentment at someone\u2019s nonexistent wife or husband. It is this origin that D\u2019Emilio credits for widespread (and still current) negative connotations of the word \u2018queer\u2019\u2013 the use as a way to self-oppress against one\u2019s perceived \u201cqueerness\u201d in times before homosexuality was recognized as an identity category is what led to it spiraling so far into taboo and contempt. (see the lgbt Studies thread for more here)\n\n2. In the first two thirds of the 20th century, homosexuality rarely became a publicly identifiable category as a result. The Scientific American article in OP\u2019s question is an example of an exception of lgbt History before queer identity was recognized\u2014 it\u2019s about enough names to create *identity* for someone or someone else. It becomes a search in the progression of increased awareness and understanding about a phenomenon, and just a phrase that one or none can relate to at any given time. \n\n3. Starting in the 1940s in a major turning point, *homosexuality became a public health concern* beginning with German exile scientist Magnus Hirschfeld and the Institute for Sexual Science. This trend took off in the United States then included fellow studies by Alfred Kinsey. Because of the continued, separate discussion of homosexuality as a clinical condition and a public health issue, American understandings and consensus classified it as *changeable*\u2014 not inherent to individual identity, and subject to therapy. It remained the consensus understanding for over thirty years. While political organizations had spun up involving sodomy law reform since the 1920s, by the early 1960s there were major homosexual organizations involved in long-term reform efforts and mass lesbian/gay presence in protest organizations.

However, the reasons for their changing meanings are complex and multifaceted.\n\nLet's start with \"gay.\" Before the mid-19th century, \"gay\" simply meant happy or carefree. However, in the late 19th century, it began to be used as a slang term for homosexual men, particularly in the United States. This usage gained traction in part because it was a euphemism for \"homosexual\" that was less socially stigmatized at the time. By the mid-20th century, \"gay\" had become widely accepted as a term to describe homosexual men and women, though some still found it pejorative. Today, \"gay\" is generally considered a socially acceptable term to describe homosexual people, though it can still be taken as a slur in certain contexts.\n\nNow for \"queer.\" Like \"gay,\" \"queer\" also had different meanings before it became associated with homosexuality. Prior to the mid-20th century, \"queer\" generally meant strange, abnormal, or questionable. However, beginning in the late 19th century, \"queer\" began to be used as a pejorative term for homosexual people, particularly in the United States. This usage gained popularity because it was seen as a way to stigmatize and condemn homosexuality, which was often viewed as a sinful or immoral choice. By the mid-20th century, \"queer\" had become a broad and highly stigmatized term for homosexuality, with many gay and lesbian activists pushing back against its use due to its negative connotations. In more recent years, some members of the queer community have reclaimed the term \"queer\" as a way to embrace their identities and challenge traditional definitions of sexuality and gender.\n\nIn both cases, the change in meaning was driven in part by the social and political context of the time. In the late 19th century, homosexuality was largely seen as a deviation from societal norms, and using terms like \"gay\" and \"queer\" as euphemisms for homosexuality had the potential to make it seem less shocking or immoral. Over time, however, as societal attitudes towards homosexuality evolved, the terms \"gay\" and \"queer\" came to be more widely accepted and embraced by the communities they described."}, {"question": "How representative is the Battle of the Somme for World War 1?", "answer": "The First Battle of the Somme (1 July \u2013 18 November 1916) was very atypical of WW1. The image conjured up in the public's mind when they see 'WW1 trenches' is from the likes of the Somme, Passchendaele and Ypres.\n\nThe First Battle of the Somme was already a heavily planned change in British warfare to create momentum through a large scale, well planned attack. It had been discussed for *ages* and *every* calculation possible was done about costs etc. The British found that the'minimal loss' concept of a trench raid no longer worked with the Germans discovering a raid planned and immediately prepared read for a counter-attack, giving the raiders no real chance for maximum success leading an example to every raider following on. Also combined battlefield snipers happened to be very effective in weeding out infiltrators leading to inefficient manning though raids were necessary. Just to underline this point, approx 1,000 raids were done on the Western Front in late 1915/early 1916, losing 150 British soldiers. On the first day of Somme alone, the first 2 objectives alone alone, from an attack force of 6 Divisions and being only 20 kilometers long 64,000 British soldiers were lost.\n\nThe actual political aspect of the attack was that the British and French discussed the attack differently and wanted to achieve very different objectives. A different author argued that it changed the standards of battle from both the British and German armies going forward.\nMW suggests the British attacked more and smaller depths of trench (from about meter to 3-10, with Salient usually not taking more than 3-4 days). Conversly the Germans *extensively* invested in well dug, well populated bunkers which when a British attack would always wait to counter-attack until the enemy had squeezed into the Stelette system (entrances to shallow trenches) then laying into them with machine guns. Thus limiting the victories of the British to first Splitz.\nAdditionally, MW points out that the trenches of the Salient served a line of command as at all times of war were needed to keep command of troops and their instruction (orders were often verbal and sometimes formal verbal instructions were sent to them, not knowing  that they have influence on Communication beyond the battlefield, they would help to trace the tactical strategist if they would be absent or missing ) and the dogs of war. \n\nThe British also started to use Ruins of buildings as front lines as rain to covered ground and natural cover. This meant an increase to casualties and length of a battle, whether it was for a good tactical position.

There was in contrast the attacking army basically being called off as there was a regroup as troop front line, directions went from ideas and verbal plans down by day, at such short notice when it came the use of trenches.of Battles took to be excruciatingly fast battles (which included the speed on even confirmed orders) and in this case a Broad attempt of the attack force of 18,000 resulted in a steady amount of casualties (on the vulnerable elephant grunds, only taken once) over the course of 3 minutes, held at beck and call.\n\nThe massive unspoken thing of the Somme was not even just the death toll, which stands in when you can imagine the throughput of personnel the force had to train, and reinforcements from other armies into a battered state to allow a larger width for the attack.

What role did Creoles play before and after U.S. acquisition?", "answer": "New Orleans had been settled by Spanish, then French. However, during most of the 1700s, New Orleans fell under neglect and outright neglect. Colonists and slaves controlled the Port of New Orleans and attained their own wealth through trade and commerce. This gave the Creoles greater audience among the French, Polish, and other colonial powers than they normally would. Not to mention, as an American article in 1819 observed,\n\n> \"The climate here is too unhealthy for the Spaniards, and too damp and malarious for the English. Even the French can not bear it; except [bilious] yellows be kept in check by science, without which they would soon desert the country.

The general direction is for \u2018all free\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a result, black free men invoked laws regarding being unservant and unenslaved. Creoles invoked the same. Laws in New Orleans made it clear that being a Creole or free of color didn't make you white. However, you could self-proclaim your status as \u201cwhite\" if you marked in on the census reports and evident your free-ness from your economic mobility. \n\nUnfortunately, it was not until Pandora's Box was opened in 1865 that Creoles could vote formally in Louisiana.", "baseline_answer": "The American acquisition of Louisiana in 1803 sparked a complex response to issues of race and social class in New Orleans. Prior to the acquisition, New Orleans was a French and Spanish colonial city with a unique Creole culture that developed over several centuries. The Creole population, comprised of individuals of mixed African and European heritage, played a prominent role in Louisiana's society before and after American acquisition.\n\nBefore the United States took control of Louisiana, Creole society held significant political, economic, and social influence. Many Creoles played significant roles in the colonial governments of New Orleans, with some serving as high-ranking officials in French and Spanish administrations. Creoles were also prosperous merchants, traders, and plantation owners who controlled a portion of Louisiana's commerce and agriculture.\n\nHowever, the lines between race and social class in Creole society were not always straightforward. The term \"Creole\" was a broader term that included individuals with both African and European heritage. As a result, there was both hierarchy and intermingling between the Creole population, with individuals of greater European ancestry often more privileged than those with more African ancestry. Slaves and free people of color also occupied a unique social position in Creole society, as they were frequently employed as skilled artisans, domestic workers, and professionals.\n\nUpon taking control of Louisiana, the United States implemented policies that further complicated social and cultural norms in New Orleans. The U.S. Government abolished slavery in the northern region of the newly acquired territory, raising questions about the status of slaves in Louisiana, many of whom were already living there. Additionally, the government's implementation of the Louisiana Land Act of 1820, which facilitated the fast sale of newly acquired lands to white settlers, displaced many Creole and Native populations, contributing to tensions between newer, white settlers and longstanding inhabitants.\n\nThese developments led some Creoles to become more vigilant about preserving their distinct cultural heritage, often through promoting education and entrepreneurship. Creole schools emerged in New Orleans as a way to provide education to youth of mixed heritage, allowing them to establish careers and social status outside of their families' professions. Creole businesses, including trade operations and restaurants, also developed during this time, contributing to the city's growing economy and occupation of significant social and cultural positions.\n\nIn this way, Creoles played a pivotal role in bridging the socio-cultural gap during the transition to American rule after the Louisiana Purchase. They mediated shifts in laws and customs, demonstrating agility in their ability to navigate and adapt to changing social conditions. As New Orleanians, Creoles helped facilitate and maintain the unique character of New Orleans into the modern period through the preservation of their Creole culture and heritage in their communities and practices."}, {"question": "Why didn't the USSR feel the need to build super-carriers or field a true blue water navy?", "answer": "The Red Navy in the 1940s was the 2nd largest navy in the world after the US; in fact, ships transferred between the US and Britain through Lend-Lease and ships that were sunk during the war were counted as part of the British Royal Navy which therefore were in total counted as part of the \"Russian\" total. In 1944 ending the war in Europe it was not entirely clear what kind of war would start next with Japan; of course originally the US and the USSR began around the Pacific but then, first by planes of the Red Air Force and later by submarines of the Red Navy stationed on Soviet territory in the Pacific sank Japanese merchant ships abroad. \n\nNazi Germany and the Japanese navy would attempt to blockade Soviet ports and limit supplies sent from America, but on the main outlet of the American support and Lend-Lease, Gotland\\K\u00f6ige bay and a few minor islands, the Soviet navy had a very large force, both highly modern submarines (among the first nuclear submarines constructed: the K-1) as well as heavily armored small ships.\n\nWhere the Red flag was run up in Europe, ships of the British which were transferred to the Soviet Navy operated.\n\nOver the summer the Soviet navy, again in accordance with the ABC-1 agreement with the Americans, entered the important areas of the Pacific.

In fact, one of his greatest speeches. This speech was given in 1938, at the start of his third term. It was before an inaugural audience. I'm going to quote a few lines from it, from a key segment of it.\n\n\n\n> \"Yet in spite of the shameful silence of the courts, too many of our industrial leaders continue to test the limits of  liberty by resorting to practices responsible for their business failure. I am a firm believer in the right to profit from a venture, but there is nothing wrong with our system that could not be cured by a different attitude on the part of business men.

Faced by a government determined to seek and maintain its national sovereignty, it is time to replace the \"price system\" by a \"work system\" for the production of goods in capitalist countries.\"\n\n\nThe reason why I chose this particular speech, and that of the following year, depends on the latter point. The 1938 one I just quoted argues that the government \"shall no longer dismiss\" unemployment, and that it's time to stop using the \"price system.\" The unique and noble positions of the depression from the 1930s rightfully characterize it as a system in and of crisis, of unemployment and underemployment at the lowest levels of production and work, and at the highest levels of production and work too. Years later, the United States had significantly lower unemployment issues, such as the rise of minimum wage (implemented under the Fair Trade Commission Act of 1935) and pea-time job creation through private companies working with the U.S. Government. From 1940 to 1945, the unemployment rate of African-American men and women dropped from around 25 and 50 percent, respectively, to around 7 and 13 percent. The focus on work, a work system, production of goods in capitalist countries had worked in an American context. This context is the most important for working class activists, in America more so than anywhere else.

Lewis, the President of the United Mine Workers, who had reportedly invited Roosevelt to arrange such a meeting.

Los Zetas, for example, came out of the ranks of Mexican special operations forces, and have effectively taken over the streets of dozens of cities (for now) throughout northern Mexico. They have highly trained operatives who fight battles, those operate with intense firepower and have overwhelming numbers in those battles. These groups came out of the military and railroaded many up from basic filto-rebel ranks. \n\nSo, while there is no one organization that is more mainstream- powerful band of drug dealers in Mexico like Field Marshall Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha used to be in Drug The Barons 3 or Cocaine Cowboys, and Colombian Capos, but there are whole cities and towns near the border that are locked down ruined cities that will likely spend years if not decades recovering. \n\nI am leaning towards at least two main reasons as to why that consortium of criminal organizations has been able to largely form (let me make two points of my own without research needed: lower levels of corruption in Mexican politics vs Colombian and politicians in northern Mexico deferring to psychological warfare from these cartels by \u201cinvesting\u201d in independents on elections). One, Mexico is in far better condition economically than Colombia. The drug trade is probably worth more money there than the rest of the Mexican economy combined  but the Mexican economy at large these days is looking a TON better than the Colombian economy. \n\nAnd still the public health aspect of drugs is far worse there than across the border, particularly on the east and west coasts. \n\nAs such, many of those criminal organizations are also running arms, oil, cyber and narcotics enterprises to empower those rings to move merchandise a little quicker. Someday the elephant in the room is that arms trade in Mexico will be ruled internationally as a monopolistic cartel led industry by way of cartel taxing. But for now the state has not been bold enough through military advantage or legislation to finish them.\n\nThe second point, as made clear many times on reddit and this website in general, is that Mexican institutions of power (police, political, journalistic) are more under funding and over committing. This is mostly due to corruption within the Mexican government. Mexico is not yet a failing state but you can certainly see down to national government levels indicators of the failed state.\n\nGuesses, at that the drug trade is fortified through involvement in politics and can seize all public health aspects of drugs as frightening and disruptive as that is to patience on both sides of the border.", "baseline_answer": "There are several reasons why power has shifted from Colombian cartels to Mexican ones:\n\n1. Changes in drug demand: Demand for drugs in the United States has shifted from traditional Colombian exports like cocaine to Mexican drugs like methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin.

MEXICAN CARTELS' TURF WARS: Mexican cartels, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and its rival the Gulf Cartel, have been involved in brutal turf wars for control of the drug trade in Mexico. These conflicts have resulted in significant violence and instability, which have had a ripple effect on the broader global drug trade.\n\n3. MEXICO'S NARCO LEFT: In response to the brutality of Mexican drug cartels, leftist organizations like the Los Zetas cartel and its offshoots emerged. These groups have emphasized politically motivated violence, targeting police officers, government officials, and other cartels, which has further destabilized Mexico.\n\n4. MEXICAN AND AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT: Mexican and American law enforcement agencies have been cracking down on drug cartels, taking down major kingpins and disrupting their operations. This has forced some Mexican cartels to shift their focus to other criminal activities, like human trafficking and kidnapping, to stay afloat.\n\nThese factors have contributed to the shifting balance of power between Colombian and Mexican drug cartels and made the Mexican cartels a greater threat to drug trafficking in South and Central America."}, {"question": "What are the origins of the modern wiccian, neo-pagan, and witchcraft groups?", "answer": "1.

While the origins of these movements are complex and varied, there are a few key ideas and figures that helped shape their development.\n\nOne influential figure was Gerald Gardner, an English civil servant and Esotericist, who is often referred to as the \"father\" of modern Wicca. In the 1940s and 1950s, Gardner claimed to have discovered a pre-Christian witch cult that had survived secretly in England, and he founded the first self-proclaimed Wiccan group, the Bricket Wood Coven, in the late 1950s. Gardner's book \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954), which recounted his supposed experiences, popularized the ancient pagan religion as a modern spiritual path.\n\nAnother important figure was Doreen Valiente, a British artist and writer who helped Gardner develop and refine the practices of Gardnerian Wicca. Valiente's work, including her co-authorship of Gardner's later book \"The Wiccan Ritual\" (1964), played a crucial role in the development of the working practices and philosophy of modern witchcraft.\n\nNeo-Paganism, on the other hand, emerged as a broader opposition to monotheistic religion, drawing on ancient pagan beliefs and practices from various traditions around the world. Some key figures and movements that contributed to the development of modern neo-paganism include the Romanian teacher and philologist Mircea Eliade, who popularized the study of traditional religions in the West, and the Council of American Witches, founded by Janet and Stewart Farrar in 1974 as a response to the Assassination of Church of All Worlds co-founder Tim Zell. \n\nMany modern pagan and witchcraft movements also draw inspiration from ancient traditions, such as Celtic, Norse, and Greek mythology, as well as alternative spiritual practices like yoga and meditation. \n\nOverall, the origins of modern Wiccan, Neo-Pagan, and Witchcraft groups reflect a complex synthesis of historical, intellectual, and cultural factors, as people seek out new forms of spirituality that resonate with them beyond the dogmas and structures of established religions."}, {"question": "Most Traveller communities in Europe are ethnic Roma.

With this second Act, authorities could toss Travellers who *had* first obtained permission into the nearest gaol, to be let go when they (and their troubles) could be moved on.\n\nAll I could find online about the *Mischievous Criminals* Act is their penal nature. Hopefully you'll post more here when you get a chance. Any thoughts, /u/johngaskin? \n\nAt the time the Acts went into effect, Traveller people tended to be part of \"Gypsies\" or colonies that had kept together through descent from the same *cabeza*,  or chief people. These chiefs also tended to be born into power, even within a self-made code of conduct, known as the cresol. This code was not written down until 1978, though it has been observed being enforced by Travellers themselves for a very long time by Traveller \"King\" Colin Reece.\n\nTraveller lore repeats a story which claims that Queen Anne signed a Royal Order removing the settlement of aka, \"Little Ireland,\" sometime in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Travellers were said to have been \"evicted\" as if they had been tenants in *use* of the land, occupying it in full legality. Nevertheless, Romanies have never seen means as the only, nor the best, of ends, and it is easy to imagine how Gallic or Spanish marauders and mendicants might have well disguised themselves as \"Gypsies\" during Queen Anne's days. Still, the Traveller population had probably grown substantially enough by the mid seventeenth century that what is now called **Partholon's Castle** potentially harm Britain's political economy.\n\nPartholon's Castle stood on the Cork hill in\n**Downpatrick** County Down. It was known previously with associated places as \"Tara Lisburnan.\" When Travellers occupied it, it was impossible for that countryside to \"earn\" for the castle the rotation of capital that Great Britain craved. By modern standards, the \"Lisburnan\" part of that name comes out of the phrase \"Lisan kianan,\" Gaelic for atheist or anarchist. Though this nomenclature probably goes back to the Irish Civil War and Northern Ireland's Troubles, the same image has been applied to southern Irish Travellers. Guerillas such as \"Dubo Tootla\" or \"Tootla Shell\" came back in the century of an increased British interest in Irish autonomy and sovereignty. This image was not, however, based in Traveller clothing alone, but in British theatrical traditions.\n\nSo we find that Traveller men's clothing of the 19th century and onwards, often vaguely styled as 'gypsy' fabric, consists of a vast shift and 'hemispheric' trousers made of a heavy coarse fabric. Shoulder straps often cross the chest with a long waistcoat, ditto trousers turning wide at the bottom. This style of trousers is not peculiar to Travellers, and was and remains a style common to the men of Amhurst County, Koguta, etc. Like old Losang Tu, the clothes worn by these men are a form of posture against the pressures in their society. Northern English and northeastern Scottish workers wore something similar when they worked. Though Travellers performed many an unskilled labour, it is important to understand that Traveller life is characterised by a kind of posture akin to a wagabond's life under an incoming conquering power, as", "baseline_answer": "The history of Travellers in Britain is a complex and contentious one, with debates over the origins, identity, and definitions of Traveller communities. Here is a brief overview:\n\n1. Origins: The precise origins of Traveller communities in Britain are unclear, with different theories proposing Romanies (ethnic Roma), Irish, and English roots. Some scholars argue that Travellers in England and Wales are descended from medieval packhorse merchants or seasonal agricultural workers, while others point to the presence of Irish migrants in the 19th century.\n\n2. Discrimination: Regardless of their origins, many Traveller communities have faced centuries of prejudice and discrimination in Britain. The nomadic lifestyle of Travellers and their tradition of moving frequently from place to place has been met with suspicion and hostility from settled communities, who often view their presence as a threat to property values, public order, and educational standards.\n\n3. Legislation: In response to these tensions, the UK government enacted a number of laws aimed at controlling the movement and settlement of Travellers. The infamous 1960s Caravan Sites Act, for example, imposed strict licensing requirements on caravan sites and prohibited the erection of new sites without local authority consent, effectively making it difficult for Travellers to find legal places to live.\n\n4. Resistance: Traveller communities have responded to these challenges in a number of ways, from street protests and direct action to court challenges and political lobbying. The Traveller Movement, for example, is a national advocacy group that campaigns for the rights and respect of Traveller communities, while previous high-profile cases such as the Doyle Commission (1981) observed the \"special needs\" of the Irish Travellers.\n\n5. Cultural traditions: Despite the challenges they face, Traveller communities have preserved a number of traditional cultural practices, from language and music to storytelling and craftwork. Many also maintain a distinct identity and sense of community, with some continuing to travel between seasonal work and festivals.\n\n6. Contemporary issues: In the 21st century, Traveller communities in Britain continue to grapple with issues of prejudice, exclusion, and access to resources. Some argue that cultural preservation efforts are essential to maintaining Traveller identity and social cohesion, while others emphasize the importance of economic opportunity, education, and social inclusion.\n\nOverall, the history of Travellers in Britain is a complex and multilayered one, shaped by a myriad of cultural, historical, and political factors. The ongoing debates over the identity, rights, and traditions of Traveller communities underscore both the challenges and the resilience of these dynamic and diverse communities."}, {"question": "To what extent did Russia's 'Vodka Tax' account for government revenues throughout history and was it as influential/important as often stated?", "answer": "Tobacco was probably the biggest cash crop in pre-reform Russian history. Production began in Russia in the seventeenth century and, by the mid-eighteenth century, nearly three-quarters of all tobacco sold in St Petersburg came from Russia. Tax on cigarettes was sold to focus on discouraging their consumption, but taxes on tobacco and by sygarettes generated significant revenue, more so than revenue from vodka until the turn of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1772 the government began construction of the first tobacco monopoly of the empire, and in 1784 it became the first goods in the empire to be taxed in fixed currency values. For many peasants it represented a new avenue of opportunity to engage in long-distance trade because tobacco was light and could be carried. In the years between 1800 and 1900 coffee\u2019s production or consumption could be taxed. While tobacco grew in the late seventeenth century, in later period taxes were paid in tea, not coffee as introduced by Catherine the Great.\n\nTobacco was a crop that both women and men were involved in until the introduction of the first tea monopoly in 1724-1727, (as well as tobacco monopolies in 1713 and 1760). During the empire\u2019s Golden Age, women farmers and traders earned more than public servants, artisans, and masters of serfs. But, after the tobacco monopoly was established, the women\u2019s income sharing rose to a rate of around 62% of the total revenue. Women farmers had the more income due to their more personalized relationship with the product. \n\nSo vodka was not the biggest cash crop, there were others. It is important to state that they operated side by side in the tsarist economy. Some crops were only related to specific time frames or people. For example, tobacco was common and popular during the Soviet era, while alcohol certainly was the legacy record of pre-reform Russian drinks. Alcohol consumption reflects the ability to bring greater financial assets. It is impossible not to mention the unfortunate exploitation of Russia's nomadic cultures' weakness. Nomads occupied each Russian village as guests of war, with their expensive vodka, which they purchased to meet the command of their chieftains. Most Russian soldiers preferred to drink the vodka instead of burning it because they could not escape their obligations. Thus, there were always those who preferred the drink to destroy so much that one could sometimes identify the taste of the local spot while the other was sygarette and sometimes tea.", "baseline_answer": "Russia's vodka tax has been an important source of government revenue for several centuries, but its significance has varied over time. Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. Peter the Great era (early 18th century): During this period, an excise tax of 25 kopecks was introduced on a quarter of a liter of vodka. The tax was intended to generate revenue for the newly established Russian navy, and it proved successful. According to some estimates, the vodka tax contributed around 10% of the state's total revenues by the end of Peter's reign.\n\n2. Catherine the Great era (late 18th century): In 1786, Catherine introduced a new tax system that imposed a higher rate on more expensive brands of vodka. This change encouraged lower-priced brands, which helped the government boost its revenues. The vodka tax accounted for around 11-12% of total state revenues during Catherine's reign.\n\n3. Tsar Nicholas I era (19th century): The vodka tax remained an important source of government revenue during this period. According to some sources, it accounted for around 17% of the state's total revenues.\n\n4. Tsar Alexander III era (late 19th century): The vodka tax was an integral part of Alexander III's modernization program. He introduced a series of administrative and fiscal reforms that aimed to increase efficiency and reduce corruption. The vodka tax was reorganized as part of this effort, and revenue collections increased. The vodka tax accounted for around 18% of total state revenues during this period.\n\n5. Soviet era: The Bolsheviks inherited a well-established vodka industry and imposed a strict cost-plus pricing system. The vodka tax remained an important source of government revenue, but its significance changed. The Soviet government regulated prices and volumes of alcohol production, and the vodka tax became a tool for controlling consumption rather than a primary source of revenue. According to some estimates, the vodka tax accounted for around 6-7% of total state revenues during this period.\n\nOverall, the vodka tax has been an important source of government revenue in Russia for several centuries. Its significance has fluctuated over time, but it has played a critical role in funding various state initiatives, from sailing fleets to modernization programs. The vodka tax continues to be an important source of revenue for the Russian government today.\n\nSources:\n1. \"The Vodka Decree of Peter the Great: A Historical and Conceptual Analysis\", Timothy Colton (2017)\n2. \"The Evolution of Excise Taxation in Imperial Russia\", Frederick B.augesson (1998)\n3. \"Russian Economy: History and Development from Peter the Great to the Present\", Richard Hellie (1982)\n4. \"Manufacturing Culture in Soviet Economic Discourse: The Political Economy of the 'Shortage' Concept in the USSR\", Olga Kryshtanovskaya (1996)\n5. \"Alcoholism: The Death of a Nation\", Dmitry V.

However some enclave of General Staff were probably quite content with having only the bombs on board if the U.S. High Command had the option of seeing them landed and secured in a remote area nearby Yokocho or dispersed to various bases. In the case of something catastrophic like Enola Gay being shot down with 2 bombs on board, for instance, if the U.S. Was able to land a QBoat of admirable tonnage with the third it would be a godsend, but first and foremost there'd have to be the desire to do so. (A case presumably is the Osaka Pilots, who made a safe landing after dropping all the bombs in their mess on KISEKA at Kahoku and Hiraizumi respectively).\nThere happens to be a suitably shaped rock near Matsushima which Captain Babcock had forwarded to R&D perhaps as early as the Bonin conflict whose advice could be seized to benefit for the Atomic Bomb's aftermath as well - by sinking the Enola Gay and the second and third bombs in a dive lasting no less than two minutes into \"X-ray harbor\".\n\nBut to answer your question directly - possible contingencies for a germline bomb, which didn't belong to any airplane but was dropped in any instance of germline warfare, lead to different speculations and to my recollection was not listed in the above paragraph.\n\n(the P-47s carrying the Mk2 Silas \"Unicorn\" rockets toward the Pyrenees and the Tudshill context were reminders of the celebrated prelude for bombing Germany toward the Belgick lieu des v\u00eapres de mars).

Seizure: Japanese forces were instructed to capture any American airmen and material that they found, including the Enola Gay's crew and the Little Boy bomb, which was packed in the bomb bay at the time. The Japanese planned to extract vital intelligence about the bomb and America's atomic capabilities, which would have been critical to their future atomic research. The US military, in turn, planned to take brutal measures if any American airmen fell into Japanese captivity, including dropping leaflets over Japan stating that any American prisoners would be executed if their lives were put in peril. It's still unclear whether the Japanese actually followed through on these orders, and no American airmen were captured at the time.\n\n2. Miscarriage: The \"Operation Revetment\" plan detailed procedures for finding, retrieving and salvaging the Little Boy bomb in the event that it missed its target or parachuted to the ground. Additionally, a second B-29 bomber would be dispatched about 45 minutes after the Enola Gay to drop the bomb in its place if the original mission failed for any reason, or later in the day if weather conditions preferred a later mission. While this aircraft was not needed during the Hiroshima mission, it was deployed successfully in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\n\n3. Shootdown: In the event that the Enola Gay was shot down or forced to ditch, the United States military prepared for the ejection and eventual return of the remaining American personnel, with every B-29 carried a life raft, a similar version of the Mae West life jacket issued to US Navy sailors, and a radio set. The US military also planned to dispatch a submarine to extricate the survivors, should the Japanese control the area or the island.\n\nAfter the mission, the Enola Gay was en route back to its airfield in Tinian, which lies off the coast of Saipan at the western end of the Marianas Islands, with its crew expecting to rest and prepare for further missions. However, this was not to be, and a special announcement was made over the intercom announcing that Japan's leaders had decided unconditionally to accept the Allies' terms of surrender, putting an end to the so-called Pacific War, and confirming the successful use of the atomic bomb as the most brutal military weapon ever created."}, {"question": "Why did the United Kingdom support Zionism?

What happened?\nAnswer: [The article you are asking about]([LINK]\nBut one also point that's been pointed out in previous research and apparently repeated by at least one historian ([LINK]([LINK]\nI actually do not believe this is entirely born out by the statistical evidence. Obviously, the quality of the game or the progress made by the offense are hard to measure with a limited data set. However, we have a large enough data set to be able to analyze passing vs. running. In a 1954 article in., H. Totten Smith used play by play data for games since three years prior to look at the connection between attempt totals. He found that offenses on average in 1954 made 38 attempts per game over an average of 62 plays per game.\nThe common wisdom, especially when this particular game was first analyzed, was that the mutates detrimental impact of passing the ball, \"give[ing] a yard three times\". And indeed teams who relied too heavily on passing failed to succeed. Smith found that when a team tuned 85% of the ball to passing they averaged just 2.81 yards per play.\n[[+[LINK]]([LINK]\n The key here is that 2.81 was the most common average yielded by teams who were very heavy in passing. However we do have data as far back as 1947 going back to that Big Ten Title game. Such comparisons were possible in 1954.\nSmith found that there was no real median average stemming from an inter dependent sample that could be ascribed to a team's passing attempts. However, when he divided up teams averaging more than 60 total plays per game into two categories, those trying to pass more than 61 times per average game compared with those averaging fewer than 39 times per average game, he could tell that the group trying to pass more often fared worse than those trying to pass less often. The team trying to pass more frequently averaged 2.86 yards per play to the increased rate of less frequently attempting throws of between 2.8 and 2.96.\nSMITH, H.

Many British politicians, particularly in the aftermath of the Holocaust, also saw Zionism as a way to provide a safe haven for Jewish refugees.\n\nOne of the most prominent advocates for Zionism within British politics was Chaim Weizmann, a Russian-born Jewish scientist who played a major role in the establishment of the State of Israel. Weizmann served as president of the World Zionist Organization and as a adviser to British leaders such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill.\n\nAnother influential figure was Arthur Balfour, a Conservative statesman who served as British foreign secretary in the early 20th century. Balfour drafted what became known as the Balfour Declaration, a letter to a Zionist leader in 1917 that pledged British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nThe influence of these and other pro-Zionist politicians was strengthened by several factors. One was the strategic importance of Palestine to British imperial interests, particularly as a buffer against Ottoman rule and as a potential pathway to the Indian Ocean. Another was the humanitarian concern for Jewish refugees, many of whom were displaced by the Holocaust and other persecution.\n\nFurthermore, Jewish communities in Britain and other western countries provided support for Zionism, both financially and politically. This support helped to amplify the voices of pro-Zionist politicians and to put pressure on British leaders to take a pro-Zionist stance.\n\nUltimately, the combined forces of historical ties, strategic interests, humanitarian concerns, and political pressure made it politically expedient for British leaders to support Zionism, even as the conflict between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine continued to simmer and eventually boil over into full-blown conflict."}, {"question": "Did Renaissance pikemen ever fight other pikemen or were they used primarily as cover for musket fire?", "answer": "<|user|> Question: Political marketing in political science. Fundraising and image building.\nAnswer: \n<|assistant|> Political marketing in political science encompasses the use of political, economic, and communication strategies to promote political ideas, parties, and candidates. Political marketing techniques focus on candidate image building through effective campaign advertising, strategic use of social media, and voter targeting. The development of professional marketing and brand expertise in political campaigns dates back to the United States presidential election of 1964. In that election, President Lyndon B. Johnson hired advertising firm Murphy Partnership to launch a massive branding campaign for his re-election bid. A massive advertising blitz featuring famous branding slogans such as \"The Solution is Johnson\" and \"All the Way with LBJ\" played a major role in his landslide victory that year. President Richard Nixon was the first U.S. President to have a professional political consultant team manage his campaigns in 1968 and 1972. In 2012, the Obama campaign's innovative use of digital technology to target voters through data analysis showed the world the full extent to which marketing and advertising techniques have become part of political campaigning.\n\nPolitical marketing in the political science is pertinent to politicians running for office at all levels and in all types of democracy whether presidential, parliamentary, or constitutional monarchy/constitutional republic. In a parliamentary system, it refers to the promotion of parties and ideology in an electoral system. Each level of government - local, provincial, national, and state - has separate sets of rules for campaigning and fundraising whereas in presidential and parliamentary systems there are more uniform rules across the board.\n\nFundraising is essential to running a successful campaign. Fundraising can take place in a variety of multifaceted forms: grassroots labour, online and offline donation, sponsorships, media advertising and promotion, and outreach to public and private sector investors.\n\nPolitical marketing and fundraising often depend on the specific electoral system of the country or jurisdiction. For example, Canada has a first-past-the-post electoral system whereas the United States, as well as Ireland, have a multiplying system, \u2018first past the post plus additional member system\u2019, and proportional representation, respectively. These differences lead directly to different fundraising considerations. For example, in Canada the federal election campaign limits a candidate to spending a certain amount per constituency; whereas federal election campaign candidates in the United States do not have a campaign spending limit.  Federal candidates for office on the U.S. side are not required to say where their funding comes from in a presidential campaign.  Political marketing and fundraising also differ based on this legal framework which is why they are becoming more important every year in U.S. Politics given the many U.S. Presidential super PACs that are influencing political campaigns with money raised from private interests. \n\nAnother spur for more emphasis on political marketing and fundraising lies in the increasing global trend of citizens\u2019 understanding of the fundraising landscape coupled with fully understanding political motivations and policy considerations. Political parties often create their own campaign spending campaigns to influence elections with the parties officially sponsored money based on members\u2019 fundraising quite popular in several democracies, including the United States, the U.K., Canada and Australia. These types of campaigns undermine the separation of parent organizations, candidate\u2019s campaigns, and the issues in the middle (politicians need to spend significant time campaigning when they should be focusing on the issues, members fundraising for them instead) \n\nUnderfunded political marketing and fundraising can have disastrous consequences for candidates\u2019 campaigns. For example, there is a huge gap between major candidates\u2019 outlay during the campaign in the U.S. - in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections Donald Trump spent less than $20 million on advertising up to 9 October which does not seem a lot to cover a campaign spanning months let alone several years. In contrast, for that same period, Hillary Clinton spent $416 million on TV and digital advertising.\n\nOn the one hand, underestimating political marketing and fundraising can cause a candidate to miss out on significant support in their attempt to position themselves as an alternative to the hothouse favorites. On the other hand overvaluing them by presenting themselves as appealing to the many failing to realize themselves that they are appealing to the few, by investing their entire fundraising skills in an effort to attract the right needs at the wrong time, risk alienating the grassro", "baseline_answer": "Arena (Orectus) B derived genes change in allergy and asthma: Researchers at Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf (HHU) have identified a further eight gene regions that are associated with allergies. In their study of more than 3000 pati- ents, the scientists showed that certain genetic variations which are already known to influence the risk of allergic diseases change the activity of the corresponding genes \u2014 the so-called effect variants. The study has been published in the current issue of the scientific journal 'Nature Genetics'. In collaboration with the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), experts from the HHU Institute of Genomic Nuclear Medicine and Biophysics and the Institute of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology as well as researchers from the German Consortium Allergies in CHildhood (GALALL\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438) and the Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands have been studying the genetic factors contributing to allergies and asthma for more than ten years. In 2013, the researchers, who are coordinated by Professor Dr Roland K\u00f6hler (Institute of Genomic Nuclear Medicine and Biophysics, HHU), identified three gene regions that are associated with asthma and which are also involved in allergic reaction mechanisms and functional nerve connections in the airways. The BAD (Associated Asthma Death) project that was initiated in 2010 is a so-called genome-wide association study (GWAS). More than 3,000 asthma patients and approximately the same number of healthy individuals participated in the work, which was also supported by the German Centre for Lung Research (DZL) and the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, Federal Ministry of Education and Research). An essential prerequisite for this study was the fact that the participating patients originated from one defined region \u2014 the west southeast of Switzerland, predominantly the canton of Zurich. The effect variants \u2014 genetic variations that are associated with diseases \u2014 were identified in this homogeneous population by means of a comparison with over 6000 randomly selected healthy persons from the region. As K\u00f6hler summarises: 'The located areas of the \"effect variants\" provide significant indications for the gene section compromised'. The specific investigated formation and function of the respiratory organs point towards allergy and asthma mechanisms in the genetic disposition that develop in childhood, thereby possibly causing an allergy \u2014 and not only asthma \u2014 in adulthood. Says K\u00f6hler: 'This is all the more true as we could verify that the identified variation is linked with the respective cellular immune responses.' Presence of an associated neuronal immune response underlines that the alteration of the genes uncovers a significance beyond asthma and indicates a generally increased allergy susceptibility. In actor-network theory (ANT), non-human objects called 'non-humans' are often thought not to be 'actors' in the sense of being active or purposeful. They lie outside of a network formed by humans, machines, organizations and processes. These non-humans, Allen calls \"inanimate actors,\" are crucial to ANT, and take on properties that do things. This shows the error of omission for neglecting the impact or meaning that non-human things bring about. However, without keeping the humans separate from non-humans, ANT should not even only be called 'actor-network theory'! Furthermore, many actors in social network graph mining are non-human computers. The notion of the meaning of actor non-humanity is an important issue for future research.

This practice of promoting Georgians, known as \"Georgianization,\" was criticized by some as nepotism and favouritism, as Georgians came to dominate key positions in the government, academia, and the arts."}, {"question": "Why was trench warfare not as prevalent in WW2 as in WW1?", "answer": "There are a couple of major reasons that trench warfare was not as prevalent in World War II as it was in World War I.\n\nFirst of all, the European terrain that made WW1 trench warfare so prevalent didn't exist in WW2. That trench warfare occurred during WW1 was due primarily to the geography of the Western Front. The terrain of Northern France and Flanders is flat and featureless. The soil can't support forests or vegetation, there are few obstacles like rivers or hills that can force soldiers to face each other, and there are numerous tunnels and caves throughout the area that made building trenches an easy process. Trench warfare in WW1 was less about strategy and tactics, and more about geography. As a result, in WW2 Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the Canadian army in WW2 liberated Sicily, and the Allies liberated Northern Africa. There were never a series of \"battles\" like WW1 where you just have to fight your way two miles. Fronts were simply too numerous and then seized too quickly.\n\nThat said, that doesn't mean that trenches were never built during World War II. In other countries like North Africa, for example, there were entire sections of the battlefield that were incredibly difficult to move over or control, that required a huge amount of infantry. In addition there were attempts in places like the Soviet Union and France, to dig trenches. However, while they worked for a little while during WW1, trenches proved to be very ineffective in World War II. One key reason was that warfare on foot became much less prevalent after the advent of armored vehicles in WW1. While trenches made slogging through difficult terrain easier during WW1, vehicles like tanks and halftracks made it even easier to traverse it in World War II. Partially as a result, trenches proved to be incredibly ineffectual in both North Africa and the USSR. As a result, both the British and the Soviet Union came armed with new, modern methods of fighting that required mobility on the battlefield, mobility which trenches wouldn't be able to provide. Fields became places to maneuver in, and to pass through quickly - not to hold and defend.\n\nOne further reason that trench warfare proved to be slightly less prevalent in World War II was its connotation with the 1914-1945 period. From a perceptual standpoint, the devastation of trenches is the experience that most people had in WW1 (instead of tanks charges, artillery bombardments, and so on). So, the primacy that trench warfare held for WW1 would have been further reinforced by the word association of \"trench warfare\" and \"First World War\". It might not be impossible to imagine trench warfare in World War II, but the context of the war and the time kept in people's minds would make it less likely to happen en-masse.\n\nI'd also like to point out that it's exceptionally difficult to reference a specific battle for any of this. While, as I mentioned in my previous answer, the Battle of Kursk was probably the most entrenched battlefield (at times, possibly the most entrenched field in history), all of the weapons and tactics developed during WWI had been turned on their head and mechanisms were destroyed with relative ease with the warfare that was going on around the battlefield. So, if I'm representing the Battle of Kursk as an example of entrenched warfare in the Eastern Front, I'm basing it almost exclusively off of the fact that the two opposing sides figured out that a tactically entrenched position would be useful for them.\n\n-------\n\nI also want to briefly make note of my messed-up formatting and answer your question briefly.\n\nedit: Special thanks to others, like Mark. N, who have educated me on everything I've had the pleasure of learning about this specific topic.", "baseline_answer": "1. Availability of technology: By World War II, new technologies such as tanks, air power, and armored vehicles had largely rendered trenches obsolete. In contrast, during World War I, these technologies were not as widely available, making trenches a more practical defensive strategy.\n\n2. Improved artillery: There was a significant improvement in artillery technology between the two World Wars. During World War II, artillery was significantly more accurate and powerful, which allowed forces to advance and break through enemy lines without the need for heavily fortified trenches.\n\n3. Blitzkrieg Tactics: In World War II, the Germans developed a new tactic called \"Blitzkrieg,\" or \"lightning war.\" This approach relied on mobility, combined arms, and fast-moving ground units, making trenches irrelevant.\n\n4. Less importance of territorial defense: Unlike World War I, World War II was largely focused on strategic bombing and invasions. As a result, the need for lengthy, heavily fortified front lines became less essential.\n\n5. Psychological factors: In World War II, soldiers were aware of the horrors of trench warfare from World War I. They recognized the devastating effects of living in confined spaces with poor hygiene and deplorable conditions, making trenches less popular among soldiers and commanders.\n\n6. Terrain: The terrain of where the battles took place in World War II was considerably different from the flat, sandy landscapes of World War I, making trenches less effective (e.g., the sandy terrain in North Africa forced troops to use more mobile, unfortified defensive positions).\n\n7. Strategic needs: By World War II, advancements in transport, communication, and road networks made it easier and faster to move troops and equipment, rendering the need for trenches less urgent.\n\n8. Air warfare: World War II also saw the significant expansion and evolution of air warfare. This allowed for aerial reconnaissance, bombing, and troop transport, diminishing the need for trenches as a defensive strategy.\n\n9. Tactical MCWs: Small caliber weapons, which were less inclined to creating dirt-encumbered trenches, arose in the 1930s, and they became primary weapons for infantry in combat situations during WWII, making unnecessary trenches which could not accommodate such weapons."}, {"question": "White people desguising as Native Americans to commit crimes has become a common trope in Western movies and TV-series.

Of the soldiers, three were killed and as many had their throats completely slit, while three hostages were taken. One is described as coming from a European nation, another is an 18-year old ship-cabin boy from Amsterdam. The ship-cabin boy is described to have also been slain. In chapter 21 he describes returning, meeting and slaying the 5 hostages, wounded in the sand, making sure that \"\"The poink just touched my flesh and yet this woman, an Indian [sic] pleased herself at my carryage of a slure, but the halt or crippled shall never live on my soil\"_Luis Voccino_, a diplomat.

During the 19th century, there were incidents of white settlers dressing in traditional Indigenous clothing and playing the role of a fake Indian. This was known as \"passing as Indian\" and was often done in order to take advantage of Indigenous people's treaty rights or to commit acts of violence against white settlers.\n\nIn some cases, white settlers impersonated Indigenous people as a way to scare other white settlers. This was known as the \"Indian scare\" and was a common tactic used by white settlers to maintain control over Indigenous lands and resources. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the trope of the \"white Indian\" in Western media is often exaggerated and stereotypical. It can perpetuate negative stereotypes of Indigenous peoples and contribute to historical inaccuracies and misinformation about Indigenous history. It is also important to understand that many incidents of white settlers impersonating Indigenous people were not done out of malice, but rather as a way to survive and adapt to new environments during a time of great social and political upheaval.\n\nTherefore, while the trope of the \"white Indian\" does have some historical basis, it should be approached with caution and sensitivity, and efforts should be made to accurately depict and represent Indigenous history and culture in Western media."}, {"question": "To the World War II historians, I want to know what island my great uncle died on in the Pacific theater.

The US history pages for the Pacific wars give you location breakdowns for each operation and task force. \n3.\tFor example, while East of Java is the collective name for all assault landings in eastern Indonesia, a break-out will point you to the ones your loved one would be involved with. The page linked provides some approximated individual operations, over time (1943-1945) and location, which might give you a lead. \n4.\tAnother such example is the Halsey Approaches outline which determination is on what carrier you served. On this example above, my uncle served on the Intrepid from mid-1944 to 1945 and was a deckhand for their aviation department. Any crew member from the Intrepid at this time will bear witness to arrival at Samar, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Leyte Gulf, Navarmine, Ulithi, Wake Island and, more likely, the continental US.

There is a great book about history of dress and the methods of work in creating textiles, but the book doesn't talk much from the slave's perspective.  I can only imagine how dangerous it could have been working with the clackers, spinners, looms etc, and in particular working in areas such as the cotton mills.   Basically, sewing was \"a girls job\" and a good way for land owners to profit off female slaves. Obviously this wasn't the *only* place slaves worked as women, but it was a large part of the textile world, and the cotton/rag mills contributed a large portion of the slavery induced labor in the region, even above mining and agriculture.

Based on the size of the ins[titutions producing the embroidery projects, there is no question that embroidery projects were a common raison d'etre for the South. Sewing and needlework were a large segment of the Southern economy.   \"This typically involved having students produce one silk item every month, and one with a design of their own. They also worked on altar cloths for churches, bandannas for ship crews, quilts and other such items, plus commission items from clients.

Main operations involved crocheting and embroidery or \"broidering\" with a custom-tailored needle. While you might assume the needle was a tool originally developed for the textile homes but early uses for iron wire, described as \"blacksmith's pied rouge\" affected primarily silk threads. While the custom needle did exist at the start of the the 20th century, it was not really made until around 1840. Much of the present day threading for embroidered designs had to conform to broke machines and had to continue to do so using even smaller simple machines in the South where 3D embroidery is less but still kept up. There is very little known about the cost of this work, the predominant research with scarce recordings, which continues to this day considering emotional cost on the girls' homes.

Part of their specific focus was related to various civic or military matters (Zeus was distinctly national, while Hera was city-linked).\n\nBut part of it also was their relationship. No other major Greek god/goddess had as much sexual intrigue and connection to sexual matters. Zeus, especially, is all about seduction. He effectively picks up Athena at a bar (you could swear she was going home with someone else, but Zeus tricked him and had his way with the goddess). I could go on, but all the Greeks knew about it. But we have oral tradition and lateness because Zeus did to the mothers of their children, the other gods, what they'd basically of started doing to mortal women.\n\nSo why? For one thing, he's the king. But historically this has been a symbolic motif of economic or political power, and as the king/leader of a nation begetting children with multiple women alongside his queen is a visual and religious representation that the king is powerful. It wasn't wrong or immoral, and neither was it worthy of praise. It was just something that was necessary.\n\nAnd the Greek practically worshipped male physicality, prowess. Women were worshipped more for their roles in the family, as mother, as wives, and a few examples of women excelling in major roles such as the sources died out.

But, since bit of data's gone more exactly with modern genetic studies, there is still more of an arcane or logical reason it was so roundly rejected. \n\nFirst engineered factor playing into the \"hypothesis's\" burying is that genetic inheritance is passed on, not entirely stored within herds, then inherited as part of the lifestyle/religion as a characteristic of that family, then so on.

He was also known for his promiscuity, as he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs with numerous mortal women and goddesses.\n\nThe significance of Zeus' promiscuity can be interpreted in different ways. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1) Fertility: Zeus' many liaisons were believed by the ancient Greeks to promote fertility, both to humans and to the earth. This is evident in his association with thunder and lightning, which were seen as natural phenomena associated with fertility and growth.\n\n2) Power and dominance: Zeus' frequent infidelities also served as a symbol of his unparalleled power and dominance over the other gods and mortals. By sleeping with women from all walks of life, he demonstrated his ability to control and manipulate them, as well as his complete disregard for the rules of conventional morality.\n\n3) Redemption: In some cases, Zeus' relationships with mortal women served as a form of redemption, allowing him to atone for past mistakes or wrongdoings. For example, when Zeus took the form of a satyr to lure Callisto into his bed, he spared her from being devoured by the bear, as punishment for her previous affront against him. In this respect, Zeus' promiscuity can be viewed as a form of justice, as he sought to make up for his past misdeeds by showing mercy toward those he had wronged.\n\n4) Complicated relationships: Finally, Zeus' relationships with mortal women were often complex and multilayered, reflecting the complex emotions and motivations of the ancient Greeks themselves. Through his interactions with mortals, Zeus provided a means for humans to grapple with the concept of divine power and morality, and to contemplate the relationships between the mortal and divine worlds.\n\nOverall, Zeus' promiscuity served as a multifaceted representation of power, morality, and human relationships, reflecting the complexities and contradictions of ancient Greek society."}, {"question": "18th - 19th Century European Armies tended to fight in ranks of men packed in formation firing their muskets.

As soon as the firearm was improved and found suitable for close-order usage, the bow disappeared. Nevertheless, as late as 1562 staff bowmen were used for field and siege defense, and massed skirmishing of archers remained a standard form of Spanish and German warfare until the eighteenth century. Even there it did not vanish completely: the Orissa Light Cavalry, first raised in the eighteenth century, continued so to be called. The only civilization to develop potent firearms on anything like the same scale as ranged weapons was resentfully Dutch, which tended to exclude firearms until they were medically necessary.\n&gt; This time was shorter in Eastern Europe: light cavalry effectively utilized its more nimble, more effective and probably more reliable bow until just before the Russian disformations.

Firstly, the effectiveness of muskets had greatly improved over the centuries, making them a more reliable and devastating weapon compared to bows and arrows. Muskets had a much greater range and could deliver a more devastating blow, making them a more desirable weapon to have.\n\nSecondly, the introduction of firearms and the widespread availability of muskets had reduced the role of archery in warfare. Bows and arrows were becoming increasingly obsolete, and armies focused instead on improving their musket lines and training their soldiers to use them more effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of bayonets also further reduced the need for archers. Bayonets were mounted on the musket and turned it into a deadly melee weapon. This allowed soldiers to switch from firing to fighting hand-to-hand, making them more versatile on the battlefield.\n\nOverall, while archers could still be of use in specific situations, such as skirmishing, tracking, or hunting, they were no longer the primary choice for infantry in large-scale battles during the 18th and 19th centuries. The combination of musket, bayonet, and drill discipline proved more than enough to successfully dominate the battlefield."}, {"question": "The US has been known as the \"world police\" but has the US ever actually engaged in an invasion of a foreign nation on a strictly humanitarian rights effort and not to secure its own business interests?", "answer": "The original answer is an excellent one.\n\nOnly times I can think of are \n\n- Western Europe after WWII where the US entered on the basis of guaranteeing allied governments protection of a democratic peoples and not liberation of Western Europe for US commercial interests. \n\n- Less than observer in response to the oil invasion of Kuwait.\n\n- NGOS going to Yugoslavia to prevent ethnic cleansing and war crimes in Bosnia, and then entering into a NATO and UN decision to bomb the nations. \n\n- Libya where there were indeed some humanitarian aims, but also a very clear agenda to stop a state from achieving nuclear weapons.\n\nnote: A definition of \"invasion\" may also be an issue here, though I understand the point the question making, which is basically \"has the US actually been engaged in using force to protect human rights on foreign soil.\" \n\nUnless someone unpacks Colombia \"peace\" columbia or Northern Marianas non-UN recognition as a nation, however, I don't think some of the referenced interventions would fit this bill in terms of international law.", "baseline_answer": "Yes, the United Nations (UN) authorized a military operation known as Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq following the Gulf War in 1991.

The mission involved providing food, medical supplies, and other humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees, as well as establishing no-fly zones to protect them from further attacks by Iraqi forces. \n\nWhile the operation did serve America's interests in some ways, such as maintaining stability in the region and preventing a humanitarian catastrophe, the primary focus was on providing assistance to the Kurdish refugees and promoting humanitarian values."}, {"question": "What options did German soldiers have in WW2 if they did not want to support Hitler?", "answer": "I must preface by asking what would you consider \"supporting Hitler\"? It is common misconception that anyone who served in the Wehrmacht was necessarily a devoted follower of the Nazi parti. The majority of soldiers were conscripts who were very cynical towards such ideals, both due to their experiences in the battlefield as well as the experiences of their parents and grandparents endured in the trenches of the trenches of WW1. This seems douchey, but we all generally know at this point that creating an army of ideologically devoted fervent believers is an entirely improbable abstract, impossible to instill in the form of a mass organisation.\n\nThat being said, desertion was commonplace, and that was one of several enforcement measures to be implemented. Our contemporary definition of desertion was not respected by the Germans at that time. Conscripts could be executed on the spot for a \"fear of the Foreigner\", desertion, attempted desertion and inability to meet quotas, and there is considerable controversy over the numbers, with the lowest figures ranging from roughly 5.000 executions to possibly 60.000. One thing that is undeniable, however, is that in 1934, roughly 250.000 soldiers were in prison and 40.000 awaited execution in solitary confinement. Although this number dropped to roughly half of that in 1939, it still a testament to how the regime perceived those who lost their confidence in the War.\n\nApart from the designed measures, there were also clandestine methods to report discomfort abuses. The KPD reported as faithfully as legitimately as cosntrable to both the Soviet Union or Amerikadeutscher Hilfsdienst. This organisation was commonly known as the \"Strength Through Joy\" as an alternative organisation to the too Nazi-dominated NSDAP party.\nThe major disadvantage of these groups is that they were subjected to harsh persecution by the NSDAP, most famously by the Reichskriegsgericht (often also referred to as the \"Wehrmachtskriegsgericht\"). This court repeatedly found men and companies of these groups responsible for being linked to the KPD and applied the harshest punishments, if not reported, by resorting to the use of secret informants that were joining the NSKK and the Hitlerjugend.\n\nApart from these groups, there was a secret organisation labelled the Sowjetische Informationsdienst, which was the embryonic stage of the Wehrkanzlei, the \"war ministry\" quickly launched in the early days of the blitzkrieg on Poland. Here, groups of wehrmacht (arguably joined by many unexpected individuals who were sympathetic to the Red Army) reporting on the four powers and their allies, where PoWs were gathered to explain the Soviet (or Allied) battle tactics as best they imply comprehension. \n\nOne of the best known such PoW was the Vice-marshal of the Luftwaffe of the time, Richard Oswald, who escaped from the Soviets, to gather a considerable amount of data on state of the Red Army, which was predominantly used in order to discredit Soviet politic benefits, stating several allegations, accusations etc. He finally committed suicide after being arrested in (at that time lord knows why he has never been). His career would have most probably been undermined by his status as PoW had the Soviets kept him alive to expose him, but they opted not to as they had no ideology (or trust) about German soldiers who they, becoming more terse with Stalin increasingly turning his eye towards the barbarian (cruel) Germany, and needed Germany's support to counter the imminent emergence of a Muslim nation. \n\nAnyway I tried using a format somewhat resembling an answer, let me know about accuracy if you think you deserve more answers.", "baseline_answer": "1. Military Desertion: A soldier who did not want to support Hitler could desert from the military. Although this was a criminal offense that could result in severe punishment, many soldiers still chose to leave the army and face the consequences.\n\n2. Refusal to Obey Orders: A soldier could refuse to follow orders that violated his moral principles, or that he believed were unjust or immoral. In some cases, this could lead to imprisonment or execution, but it was seen as a better option than actively participating in something that went against their beliefs.\n\n3. Active Resistance: Some soldiers went further and actively resisted the Nazi regime. This could take many forms, including sabotage, mutiny, or participation in the resistance movement. Active resistance was risky and could result in death, but it was still a way for these soldiers to make a difference.\n\n4. Staying Neutral: In some cases, soldiers may have simply tried to remain neutral and avoid getting involved in the political ideology of the regime. They may have kept their heads down and focused solely on completing their duties, hoping to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n\n5. Waiting it Out: German soldiers who were captured by enemy forces often found themselves in the position of having to choose between supporting Hitler or facing punishment from the conquering army. Some chose to wait out the war in captivity, hoping that things would resolve themselves once the war was over.\n\nIn any case, there were risks and consequences to refusing to support Hitler, and soldiers who chose to do so often had to face severe punishment, including imprisonment and execution.

Schol"}, {"question": "Were there any sceptics during the ages of Witch Hysteria?", "answer": "The crests of a number of families in a few 17th century Scottish Highlands were said to be symbols of protection against supernatural powers.  The key to characterising the Witch Hysteria is that rather than being irrational acts by people without knowledge that it was all superstition, it was part of a system of law which consumed the lot of Europe for centuries. It had its boosts from significant scientific theory beliefs, particularly the fairly well established theory of humours (that foursome or something).\n\nOf course were sceptics there?  Of course there were.  But were they in the majority?  Of course not. As with all these things, it is impossible to know certainly whether the people who believe weird stuff isolated from the pack as a trio, or if there were decent numbers outside of it (as John Winthrop suggested for early America).  Ceci N'est Pas Une Vague Threat by Imran Ali gives a very pointed and technical scientific-to-raison-d'etat history of The Mess that the CIA Was (but China tells itself this story as well) as the two orthodox sciences really get underway and focuses on establishing an hierarchy of knowledge that restricts scientific discovery to a select group (state, academic, otherwise emerged as organisationally useful in advance to avoid mechanic systems classification) disciplinary area the world over and that keeps many inefficiencies around.\n\nImportant within that big of a process for my point is through great scientific work that all contributed to the then untheoremised fields' development, certain prominent, I/we daunting English worked out that although there was an obvious cut-off between the religiously moral and scientifically hopeful groups, the former thought the later a threat to their careers, hence corruption of their organisations and an explicitly partnership in the future state organisation (state organ for short) and encouraged sceptics to be relentless public blasphemers.  After the crests and majesty of the English system dies out by the new millennia, the public are issued with a revised Public Order Act.\n\nBefore the whole thing starts again properly however, with less chaos, a scientific system begins.  Before you know it, sociologists are coming to focus not so much on the state in a new alliance with religion (and generally see lots of other functions at play), but also, these sects in science are identifying bad, prejudiced ideas within them which are doing it just as much damage.\n\nSo what's the result, you think?  Well Piers Plowman is still stupid et al, Faust and all that, but it is quite a bit better.  A lot more broadly, this pretty base theory of knowledge follows the former disharmony between Divine and the natural hygiene of mathematical law as filtering out anyone who is scientifically illiterate.  Yet within that, you are going to get those believing some unprocessed bits of modern scientific fact believing them are hacking a crackshot simulation responsible for design, networks, stuff, etc.  As you see this plays out a lot as people claim consciousness is a bad idea.  Most science I know is just finding that live life it is actually impossible to quantify or fit to similarly bend quantum science mechanisms.  \n\nThis system generally propagates a really tentative legal system as a brand new largely harse science moves from knowledge to a business.  On blocks hidden to customers it was branded a capitalist tactic in probably the most religiously Marxist affair likely to ever go for calling out Richard Dawkins.  There constantly seemed to be a single, in need of converting pursued by the whole salty-fleshed lot of (patriarchal) science.  This is a large legal system headed up by a powerful academic CEO which (in addition to police) automatically extends to amongst *all* science stretching away hidden from almost everyone for almost everybody as their research.  They have certain conflicts of interest with using anyone for most but their own organisational functions so all science seems like an inordinate unpaid taxi service for'science'.\n\nAlthough not even students, who pay a *lot* to be part of those (free, underpinned from marketing) business structures, do not necessarily agree all do it, and all perceive the whole process is not their form of sciences (very useful in the long run), the taxi service(\\*s) are functioning (there seems to have been claims the psychological view of the part of science we use (ref http://www.psychemedica.com/labs/howell_lab/index.html), but any range of psychological testable stats whereby boosting them", "baseline_answer": "Yes, there were sceptics during the ages of Witch Hysteria. While many people believed in witchcraft and accused others of being witches, there were also some who doubted the reality of witchcraft and spoke out against the witch hunts.

Others were religious leaders who opposed the persecution of innocent people on the grounds that it went against the teachings of Christianity. Despite the dissenting voices, however, the belief in witchcraft and the persecution of witches continued for several centuries, and it was not until the Enlightenment that the notion of witchcraft lost its credibility and became a subject of historical inquiry rather than a matter of moral and religious concern."}, {"question": "What German infantry armies were used during the third battle for Kharkov?", "answer": "6.Panzerarmee GeneralobersT.H.E. von Manstein\n   - 3.Panzerkorps General\u00df-Gunther Blumentritt\n      - 9.Panzerdivision Generalleutnant H\u00fcbner\n      - 11.Panzerdivision Generalleutnant [Johann Knobelsdorff-] von Trotha\n      - 57.

Here's the answer for that. Von Manstein attempted several different plans of harassment and diving into the enemy, the most risky of which was yet another Stauffenberg plot in September of 1943 that dragged on to almost brutal ends just prior to the heavy push at Kursk. Casualties were horrific on both sides.

While some lower-class indigenous cuisine has been documented, it's generally believed to differ significantly from what was served to royalty.\n\nBased on the available evidence, however, we do know that pre-Columbian high cuisine in Mexico and Central America was as inventive and diverse as it was indulgent. Here are a few key features that stand out.\n\n1. Chocolate: The most famous (and unusual) pre-Columbian ingredient is chocolate, which originated in Central America and was consumed in various forms before the Spanish arrived. In its simplest form, prepared chocolate (known as xocol\u0101tl in Nahuatl) was a thick, bitter drink prepared from ground cacao beans, sugar, water and various seasonings, such as chili peppers, vanilla, or orange peel. In its most luxurious form, chocolate was mixed with various ingredients like honey, flowers, and spices, and served to nobles in elaborate gold or silver vessels. It was also, apparently, an aphrodisiac.\n\n2. Corn: Cooked corn (known as nixtamal) was the most important staple of Mesoamerican cuisine, and was ground into masa (dough) and cooked into tortillas, tamales, and other dishes. Maize varieties that grew in the highlands, including the notable blue and red varieties, also held cultural, medicinal and religious significance for Mesoamericans.\n\n3. Wild Ingredients: While meat was relatively rare in pre-Columbian diets, Mesoamerican cooks utilized an incredible variety of wild ingredients. These included a wide array of edible flowers, amarants (similar to spinach), agave products, various sorts of bushmeat, and, in some coastal regions, seafood like lobster, conch, and clams.\n\n4. Spices and Seasonings: While the New World lacked many of the spices later popularized in European cooking, pre-Columbian cooks still had a number of special ingredients at their disposal. These included chili peppers and other peppers like epazote (used as a seasoning in black beans), avocado leaves, and annatto seeds (used to color foods like tamales).\n\n5. Maize-Based Ferments: Maize-based ferments called chicha (or tesg\u00fcino) were a staple in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican diets. Made by fermenting masa with water over several days, chicha was a popular and cheap alternative to beer (which had yet to be introduced). It was consumed in liquid form with meals or, in its thicker guise, as a side dish or condiment to meat.\n\n6. Novel Ingredient Parings: Another intriguing feature of high cuisine is the pairing of seemingly disparate ingredients. For example, the Aztec suggested pairing spicy and cool ingredients together, like chili peppers and avocado, or chocolate and lime, while the Mixtecs suggested pairing nettles with chicken and corn. It's not entirely clear whether these pairings were guided by health concerns, cultural associations, or simply a taste for contrast in flavors.\n\n7. Cuisine as Status Symbol: As already mentioned, elite Aztec cuisine was notably rich and indulgent. In fact, the Aztecs were known for their obsession with food as a status symbol, and much effort was expended in growing and preparing the very best and rarest ingredients. High-ranking officials were expected to have specialized food knowledge (usually associated with women), and some nobles believed that the quantity and quality of food served to them by their retainers directly correlated with their own social ranking.\n\nIn summary, pre-Columbian cuisine was rich, indulgent, and surprisingly innovative, with chili peppers, maize,"}, {"question": "How did the different Japanese scripts evolve and why are all three still used today?", "answer": "There is quite a bit of lore and legend as to when *kanji* were introduced to this continent, but we actually have a wealth of textual evidence to say that *kanji* were officially introduced to Japan during the 500 CE period of history we now associate as the *kofun* period. Along with mid 300 CE figurines of Kannon Bosatsu, depictions of Gigalithic stone tombs, and overall greater and greater material wealth in rural Japanese communities, we also know at this time that Japanese royal courts were looking to adopt highly prestigious foreign writing systems to do a number of different things: one was elite status production, and two was education. Perhaps the rationale for this was that 300- 500 CE wasn't necessarily a good time to be on a Sino-Korean peninsula, but that is considerably simplifying and demonstrating a lack of knowledge of the history and complexity of archaic China and Korea.

If a text of folklorization and legend was to take the textual ramblings of this history at its most basic level, this history would cause people to say that *Hanzi* was only until the 17th century in Japan a western writing system that was only practiced by Confucian scholarship elites.\n\nThe 17th century picture is the fictitious strawman set up as the center of the most pessimistic views of education in Japan, set against character-dialect variants and variants itself that vary from small to dramatically large depending on the language of the text (Japanese, Korean, China, Vietnamese, and Manchu, each represented in name by a few samples of printed text.

In fact, there are two possible variants:** nominals* varying from word to word for words to which the \"contrastive\" and \"broad\" of English contains. Neither of these categories for the individual variation only contain a word but more words and phrases that approximate the \"category.\"\n\nNow I go off on a few tangents to say that obviously, I take classification of based in the common identity, keystone to grammar differences. It is precisely because the written language I type in can be stylized just as much as it  can be reduced to pure sound units that *'through' metaphors* are present to contain what is within the purview of language.\n\nA Neogrammarian way of addressing these variances would not be too far off the idea that resultant noun, verb, and nominal categories as I mentioned above (like root or stem) are productive elements of a whole language.

The evolution of these scripts is closely tied to the history of Japan and the transmission of culture from China and Korea.\n\n1. Kanji (\u6f22\u5b57): Kanji are Chinese characters that have been adopted into the Japanese language. The original use of kanji in Japan can be traced back to the 5th century AD, when Korean scholars brought their knowledge of the han'gul script to the Japanese court. The initial purpose of kanji in Japan was to record official documents and communicate with the Chinese.\n\nEarly on, Japanese scribes were free to innovate with kanji, creating new characters and compound words that reflected their own culture and language. The Kamakura period (1185-1333) saw a proliferation in the use of Chinese characters, as Japanese authors began incorporating them into their native literature. This fusion produced an explosion of kanji usage that has continued to this day.\n\n2. Hiragana (\u5e73\u4eee\u540d): Hiragana, which first appeared in the early 10th century, were developed as a phonetic script to accommodate native Japanese words that did not have equivalents in Chinese. Hiragana characters represented Japanese sounds that were not conveyed through kanji, such as the vowels a, i, u, e, and o.\n\nHiragana played a key role in the creation of the novel, as it enabled authors to write sweeping tales of Japanese culture in a language that was accessible to everyone. The rise of popular fiction during the Edo period (1603-1868) coincided with the increasing popularity of hiragana.\n\n3. Katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca): Katakana are another set of syllabic characters that emerged in the late 19th century, specifically used for foreign loanwords and scientific terminology. Katakana letters are shorter and rounder than hiragana, with a distinct appearance that typifies modern Japanese graphic design. Although they initially fell out of use during World War II, katakana have experienced a resurgence in recent decades, due to their practicality in representing foreign sounds.\n\nToday, all three scripts are still used in modern Japanese, with kanji symbols serving as a bridge to China and Korea, hiragana representing the native language, and katakana providing a means to convey foreign sounds. The versatility and complexity of these scripts continue to evolve, reflecting the ever-changing nature of the Japanese culture and society.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of Japanese scripts is a rich and multifaceted history that bridges East Asia, reaching back through time to intermingle with Chinese and Korean cultures while also reflecting the uniqueness of the Japanese language and society."}, {"question": "In history's totalitarian regimes (i.e. Nazi Germany and USSR), how much would an average person be punished for criticizing the government?", "answer": "Well, this is a hard question to answer since the degree to which a critique is seen as 'criticizing the government' isn't that straightforward, and got worse as time went on. \n\nAmerican citizens, allied USSR citizens, and conquered Commonwealth citizens were allowed to legally criticize the German government without fear of criminal punishment in the [3rd Reich]([link]([LINK] ) and in the USSR, at least on rare occasions, but even mundane speech was outlawed out in the periphery of the state from early on and getting harsher as time went on. \n\nComplaining about government policy to the authorities and especially criticism of Hitler's/Stalin's person clearly was going to cause trouble though.

The Nazi regime maintained a strict censorship policy, controlling all forms of media and prohibiting any critical content. Those caught disseminating such content could face imprisonment in concentration camps or summary execution.\n\nIndividuals caught speaking out against the regime were frequently denounced as \"enemies of the state\" and subjected to police and Gestapo harassment. In some cases, family members and friends of the critic were also targeted by the authorities as a form of punishment.\n\nIn extreme cases, particularly during the later stages of the regime, criticism of the government could be interpreted as an act of high treason, resulting in the death penalty. However, the degree of punishment varied depending on the perceived seriousness of the criticism.\n\nIn the Soviet Union (1917-1991), criticizing the government could also result in severe punishment, depending on the nature of the criticism. Under Stalin's rule (1928-1953), the regime relied heavily on repression and terror to maintain its grip on society, suspected opponents were dealt with brutally.\n\nThe punishment for criticizing the government in the Soviet Union could range from being sent to a \"correctional labor camp\" (known as the GULAG), where prisoners were forced to work in appalling conditions, to being sentenced to death. The less serious forms of criticism, such as public expressions of doubt or disagreement, were often resolved through internal Party discipline and warnings, but if the criticism was deemed more serious, it could result in imprisonment or execution.\n\nIn summary, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union maintained strict control over public dissent; criticism of the government could result in severe punishment, including imprisonment, forced labor, deportation, and execution.

Some Druze had deep-seated religious and historical ties to the Jews, going back centuries. In fact, during the Byzantine era (5th-15th centuries), the Druze communities in the region lived side by side with Jewish communities in relative harmony.\n\nMore recently, many Druze villages were located in close proximity to Jewish settlements. This proximity led to close economic and social ties between the two communities.\n\nAdditionally, some Druze saw the Arab defeat in the 1948 War as a bitter pill they could not swallow. They felt betrayed by the Arab League's decision to go to war with Israel and saw their fate intertwined with that of the Jewish state.\n\nDuring the war, the Druze Battalion played a crucial role in containing the Arab Legion's advance in the southern part of the country. In one major battle, the Druze troops held their ground against a much larger Arab force at Mizpeh Ramon, providing a crucial respite for the besieged kibbutzim in the Negev.\n\nThe service of the Druze Battalion earned them respect and admiration from the Jewish population.

This allowed the government to provide alternatives to military service for the elite. As agriculture became more efficient, the military became less essential for survival, allowing other paths to power.\n\n2. Civil service exams: During the Han Dynasty, the Chinese government established a merit-based civil service system, allowing those outside the warrior aristocracy to advance through examination, rather than military prowess.\n\n3. Confucianism: Confucianism, the dominant Chinese philosophy, emphasized the importance of social order and stability over martial prowess. As such, the Chinese elites focused on education, scholarship, and bureaucracy rather than military conquest.\n\n4. Centralization: The Chinese state became increasingly centralized with the consolidation of power by the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.

Why is learning a foreign language important for historians?\n\nLearning a foreign language is essential for historians because many historical documents, primary sources, and scholarly works are written in languages other than English. Historians who can read and interpret these texts in their original language can gain a deeper understanding and more accurate interpretation of historical events. Additionally, historians who can communicate with scholars from other countries in their native languages can collaborate more effectively and participate in international conferences and research projects.\n\n2. Which foreign languages are most important for historians to learn?\n\nThe foreign languages that are most important for historians to learn depend on the specific historical period or region they study. For example, historians of ancient Greece and Rome may need to learn Greek or Latin, while historians of medieval Europe may need to learn Old English, Old French, or Old German. Historians of modern Europe may need to learn multiple languages, such as French, German, and Russian, depending on the countries and time periods they study.\n\n3. How can historians learn foreign languages efficiently?\n\nHistorians can learn foreign languages efficiently by:\n\na) Immersing themselves in the language as much as possible, such as by spending time in a country where the language is spoken or watching films, listening to radio shows, or reading newspapers in the target language.\n\nb) Using language learning apps, software, and online resources like Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Babbel, or Coursera to learn grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.\n\nc) Practicing conversation skills with language exchange partners or tutors through websites like iTalki, Preply, or Verbling.\n\nd) Reading historical documents and secondary sources in the original language to increase comprehension and fluency.\n\ne) Joining language clubs, discussion groups, or online forums to connect with other language learners and native speakers.\n\n4. How do foreign languages enhance historical research and interpretation?\n\nForeign languages enhance historical research and interpretation in several ways:\n\na) Providing access to primary sources that cannot be translated accurately or require interpretation by native speakers.\n\nb) Facilitating communication with scholars and local communities in other countries, which can lead to new discoveries and perspectives.\n\nc) Enhancing critical thinking and analytical skills by requiring historians to interpret linguistic and cultural differences.\n\nd) Broadening the scope and complexity of historical research by introducing new perspectives, evidence, and theories from other languages and cultures.\n\n5. How can historians overcome the challenges of learning foreign languages?\n\nHistorians can overcome the challenges of learning foreign languages by:\n\na) Setting realistic goals and expectations, such as achieving basic conversational skills or reading fluency within a specific timeframe.\n\nb) Developing a consistent and structured study plan, such as spending a certain amount of time each week on language learning activities.\n\nc) Seeking out resources and support, such as language teachers, tutors, or study groups, to increase motivation and accountability.\n\nd) Approaching language learning as a progressive, lifelong process, rather than a one-time, final test.\n\ne) Embracing the challenges and mistakes that come with learning a new language, as they are essential for progress and language acquisition."}, {"question": "There\u2019s a lot of talk about social customs dying because of Covid-19.

Certainly, there were a number of laws put into effect to maintain social order in the Roman Empire (such as strict laws against cutpurse or theft) but these were not very effective ways of maintaining order. An important factor in the maintenance of social order was a complex social contract that existed between the upper classes and the lower: most lower class Romans obeyed laws out of habit because a violation would result in a loss of economic opportunity (shopkeepers often fixed merchandise such as pottery so that it could not be stolen, for example) but most of the violent crimes that we associate with \"lawlessness\" were committed by the poor, who had no property to steal and therefore nothing to lose when they committed violent acts. Every Roman citizen expected to be able to earn a living, and this expectation extended even to such unmirable classes as gladiators, who were regularly paid fairly well to fight, so some modicum of civic order and social mobility was in place. \n\nAdditionally, the Romans didn't mind instituting great violence against criminals in order to maintain order. If street violence and petty banditry, for example, became too severe to be ignored, the authorities would not hesitate to hang the guilty in chains in public or feed them to the lions. A strong dichotomy between the upper and lower classes allowed the former to feel they had little need to help the lower, while the situation of the latter remains important.\n\nIn an interesting turn, there is one more thing that really helped the Romans to keep the streets safe: their cultural belief in the strong emphasis on face (so the saying goes) and personal pride of your average male. A man was responsible through his entire life to protect his own character in Rome through his very person, and, for example, was often asked to personally swear on his own honor to testify that something or other happened. This trust in one's word and its very real effect on the ethos of Roman people created an even stronger element of social order (but also social disintegration when infamy was notorious and one's honor destroyed), much more powerful than any legal ordinance. However, this also naturally couldn't *just* be the only thing holding these people back: even within the most supposedly orderly of ancient societies, there were bands of aristocrats that would be known for their adherence to things like \"bours and booze\" and their desire to cause trouble in the streets or termed \"t declined\" or suffer from a serious bout of lethargy or despair: those OE authors do not see Civil War fatigue...they see violence but one at a time. Also, I wish more people realized how much violence, bloodshed, and violence against civilians is chronicled just through literate sources from ancient Rome!\n\nUpdate: I apologize for more or less promoting shame as being a panacea or something, I must not have worded it absolutely clearly back there: I believe it to be an underlying factor in any social order, which works in conjunction with many factors and laws and ordinances that also result in the maintenance of social order. Of course, I still cannot stress enough how incredibly fluid life was in Ancient Rome and that it would be incredibly unwise to regard the Roman people as \"naturally fine\" and intrinsically proud and orderly because they were barbarians etc. It was, of course, a social order that directly perpetrated pillaging, conquest, loot, and worse things and were both a product of, and a promoter of that violent environment. Nonetheless, pride and and actual perception of one's self as a *loser* and one's place in society is incredibly important for maintaining order.", "baseline_answer": "While ancient Rome did not have a centralized police force as we know it today, civic order was maintained through a combination of civic duties, strong social norms, and legal institutions.\n\n1. Civic duties: Roman society placed a strong emphasis on the duty of every citizen to serve the state. This included serving in the army, holding public office, and participating in the legal system. Men who met certain standards of wealth and classified as \"citizens\" (as opposed to \"non-citizens\" or \"slaves\") were often conscripted for these roles. Therefore, they had a vested interest in maintaining order, as disturbances and violence threatened the stability of society.\n\n2. Strong social norms: Roman culture placed a high value on personal honor, reputation, and duty to the community. Roman citizens were expected to behave with restraint, self-control, and a sense of shame, known as pudicitia. This cultural expectation helped maintain order, as individuals internalized these values and held themselves accountable.\n\n3. Legal institutions: Although there was no professional police force, there was a complex legal system in place to handle disputes and crimes. Criminal offenses were heard by magistrates or provincial governors who could impose fines or imprisonment as punishment. Political institutions like the Senate and Assemblies could also pass laws to maintain order, such as the Lex Julia de maiestate, which criminalized speech or actions that threatened the Roman state.\n\nIn summary, civic order in ancient Rome was maintained through a combination of civic virtues, strong social norms, and legal institutions that relied on citizen participation and social cohesion."}, {"question": "What happened to Gavrilo Princip after he killed Franz Ferdinand?", "answer": "That's a great question.

And both of these tremendously uncritical views on random Germans sook on immensely in perceptions our age. They supposed a mass German adherence to genocide \u2014 both of Hitler and the exploiters who hoped to profit from it. That was because of media which figured a German citizenry that was, simultaneously, totally ignorant of the evil incubating on their soil and wholly enthusiastic for it.\n\nAnd by 1945 (and before) a grave injustice had occurred to the German victims of the Nazi Holocaust.

This program targeted individuals who had played key roles in the Nazi regime, including high-ranking party officials, judges, and police officers. The denazification program involved various stages, starting with the screening of individuals for any past Nazi activities, followed by possible \"exoneration\" if it was deemed that the individual was simply a minor party member or had committed acts under duress. For more serious cases, \"major\" or \"minor\" punishments were imposed, ranging from fines to loss of civil rights.\n\nMany Germans who had actively supported the Nazi regime were removed from positions of power, lost their jobs, and in some cases, were placed in internment camps or prisons. A significant portion of the population faced financial penalties in the form of fines and reparations payments to the victims of Nazi crimes.\n\nRededucation:\n\nTo help rebuild the country and avoid the repeat of fascist tendencies, reeducation programs aimed at clearing the minds of Europeans against fascist ideologies were instituted. Concepts like antisemitism, dictatorship were put under intense debate in classrooms to promote a diverse and tolerant outlook. Both children and adults underwent such programs to learn new democratic ideologies.\n\nLegal Accountability:\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials, conducted by the Allies between 1945 and 1949, brought significant legal accountability for Nazi war crimes. The process also helped to reconstitute the irrefutable rules of international law and the ban on acts of genocide. Throughout the trial, defendants such as Hermann G\u00f6ring, Rudolf Hess, and Joachim von Ribbentrop received lengthy prison sentences or received death sentences.\n\nThese measures helped to purge Germany of its Nazi past as denazification programs and reeducation initiatives significantly diminished the dominant position of Nazi sympathizers in public life, while conscience education laid the groundwork for a more tolerant, democratic, and inclusive society.

While the diagnoses and terminology are different, there is evidence that soldiers from ancient times through the early 20th century experienced symptoms that we would now recognize as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and suicidal thoughts.\n\nIn ancient Greece, for example, soldiers suffering from a condition known as \"krataiienthron\" (literally \"quaking in the chest\") were recognized as having symptoms that are similar to those seen in modern-day PTSD. These soldiers experienced intense fear, trembling, and nightmares, as well as physical symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite, and sweating. Plutarch, a Greek historian, wrote that \"men go crazy when they have seen too much bloodshed\" and that \"the mind is overwhelmed and broken.\"\n\nSimilarly, during the medieval period, soldiers suffering from what was known as \"mal-de-Campagne\" exhibited symptoms that included memory loss, fatigue, and depression. These symptoms were often associated with prolonged exposure to combat and were seen as a natural consequence of warfare.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, soldiers experienced what was then known as \"soldier's heart\" -- a condition that produced symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and heart palpitations. As the war continued, the prevalence of soldier's heart increased, with some estimates suggesting that up to 20% of Union soldiers and 10% of Confederate soldiers suffered from the condition.\n\nIn the years following the Civil War, the concept of \"shell shock\" emerged during World War I, as soldiers who had experienced the horrors of trench warfare exhibited symptoms that included amnesia, paralysis, and confusion. This condition would later be renamed \"combat stress reaction\" and then \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" during the Vietnam War era.\n\nWhile the symptoms and diagnostic terminology have evolved over time, the fact that soldiers have experienced psychological trauma as a result of warfare is not a new phenomenon. The military has been grappling with the impact of war on its soldiers' mental health for centuries, and there has been a growing recognition in recent decades that adequate support and treatment is essential for helping vulnerable soldiers recover from the psychological scars of war."}, {"question": "Why Stalin's collectivisation caused famine and poverty in the USSR?", "answer": "It is completely understandable to ask why a central planing economic system ended up with large scale famine and poverty in Russia. The questions and confusion about the Soviet economy make a lot of sense and make one wonder whether something fundamentally flawed in this entire project. I claim that much of this is because the Bolsheviks and Soviet planners did not answer two key questions when they came up with their theories of economic development, and building them in the absence of answers through practice was extremely tacky and revolutionary. There is no alternative to the creation of some basic theories to build practical knowledge, and I believe the Bolshevik project lacked this part.\n\n1) **What are markets for? And what in a market economy is attributed to non-market institutions?**\n\nMany economists working for Soviet Russia appear to have gotten their start in economics during the labor-time auctioning and pricing experiments that Lenin implemented to completely remake the Russian economy as directed by a centralized scale of values. This had been discussed occasionally in Anarchist programs, but could not effectively exist even in Anarchist programs due to the fact that those systems were all predicated on more or less direct producer ownership, and the labor-time equivalent is a term of control over something. \n\nThis was also clashing with the view that entered Russian economics from the West through the Bolsheviks, simply that anything bootstrapped from the private sector is to be considered secure for international competition.  Many markets existed in pre-revolutionary Russia and plenty of trading activities were hustled across Eurasia of the Cold War. But it was still the amazing wealthy Russians and their families who controlled the distribution networks and the goods of Imperial Russia, and a simple point of market education was that in addition to ownership workers do good and better work when there is some incentive to competing for work in the open market. This is the kind of nonsense that the Bolsheviks took very seriously. \n\nOne of the ways that the Soviet economics differed in this stage is very glaringly obvious to me- the workers are not making a product, in the socialist economy, they are making a quota. The differences here are at a superficial level and so demonstrative of the gaps in Soviet theory. This is not about exhaustion preventing good labor, equilibrium of supply and demand (which relies on an order of one and not an order of many in industrial society), or even competitive work environments as Lenin's Narkoiades and preliminary manufacturing centers on agittrain included. Meeting quotas was an expansion in social organization to Soviet Communism. This was never profitable to Lenin (or it seems to any of the Bolsheviks), it was profitable because completing quotas allowed the revolutionary socialism to expand in Russia. \n\n2) **Collective Agricultural Sector and Private Sector Agricultural Sector: What Kind of Monopoly is it?**\n\nWhen collectivization began it was not as imperative as one would suppose that the vast majority of farming activities were bought into the state sphere. I would say that under either Marxian or Russian economics, there was at no point a clear conception for private farming. The origins of this beef however, came in part because private buildings like housing and farms had to be redistributed to soviet housing, but also because the definition of property had shifted from what it was before.\n\nBefore the property owed to a Collegium or Court was presupposed to remain important and profitable as did Material things, but now equipment was seen as an extension of Labor and its class code (college of machinery, a college of a single role, sometimes kind of fancy enuf to reflect ownership relations instead of ownership like a seigneurs, and still the empire maintained that Marxian view that industrial society was the eventual end of agricultural society).  \n\nThe closest Sequel to this is a Landed Aristocracy with modern technology, most of western property has land or contracts with firm property controls. The bottoms of land are usually not meant to be built upon, and most seignore land has certain military obligations. The Marxists come from their 19th Century antipathy to country living, but so did Dyer D. Lum, Frantz Fanon, and Karl Marx himself. This creates a massive problem on imposing socialist property ownership on agricultural communities because in the west, the line between profitable land rights and unprofitable land rights is based on the amount of prestige and abundance for the owner and the workers, which has been baked in to land and property for centuries, not meant to observe the estate of production, but the estate of feudalism.", "baseline_answer": "Joseph Stalin's policy of collectivization, which aimed to transform private agricultural land into state-run collectives, caused a famine and widespread poverty in the Soviet Union for several reasons:\n\n1. Forced Collectivization: \n\nStalin's policy of collectivization was implemented with extreme speed, causing panic and confusion among the peasants. Many peasants resisted the ruling, as they feared losing their land and independence. As a result, Stalin's regime responded with brutal repression, including imprisonment, deportation, and executions.\n\n2. Harsh Methods and Disregard for Agricultural Realities:\n\nStalin's regime forced peasants to join collectives, without considering the consequences on agricultural productivity. Many collectives did not have the resources, tools, or infrastructure necessary for successful farming. The government's harsh methods, including the destruction of livestock and grain, further harmed productivity.\n\n3. Poor Crop Output:\n\nThe poor crop output during collectivization, a consequence of the previous reasons, led to serious food shortages. With no alternative sources of food, this resulted in a catastrophic famine between 1932 and 1933, with going estimates between 6 million to 16 million deaths due to starvation.\n\n4. Economic Impacts of Famine:\n\nThe famine and poverty affected the economy of the Soviet Union as well. With millions of people dying, the remaining population struggled to survive, leading to a decline in labor productivity and a spike in mortality rates. The famine also led to an increase in the spread of diseases due to malnutrition and inadequate sanitation.\n\n5. Impact of Russian Famine on Soviet Genocide Debate:\n\nThe Russian famine of 1932-1933 remains a contentious issue in the Soviet genocide debate, with some historians arguing that it constituted genocide against specific ethnic or national groups such as Ukrainians. Others criticize this view, stating that the famine was not premeditated, and Stalin and his regime were solely focused on achieving collective farming goals.\n\nIn conclusion, Stalin's collectivization policy had devastating consequences for the Soviet Union, such as famine, poverty, and economic disruption that led to significant population loss. The policy's harsh implementation, disregard for agricultural realities, poor crop output, and overall socio-economic impact continue to be analyzed and debated by historians to this day."}, {"question": "WW1: When artillery pieces were captured during offensives, were they pressed into service by the capturing army?", "answer": "I need to make a correction since the  other answers have pointed out I was mistaken; BUT, among the anti-Zimmermann Diary sleuthers I've found in my researches for Historicity of Arcturus, there was a member of the House of Lords who thought that the provision in the sunken U-Boat Bremse About the entraining of boarded crew-members 'till they were exchanged. *he wasn't the only noble to serve his nation by refitting German shipping. \n\nAs to when Jellicoe erred, no one thought this had been the intention of the Laws of Warfare when they were initially drawn up.

Many people died from starvation, and it is estimated that around 10,000 to 15,000 Muslims and Jews were killed during the siege.\n\nPrices for food and supplies surged, making it difficult for the common people to afford necessities. Many people were forced to sell valuables or take out loans at exorbitant interest rates to survive.\n\nWomen and children were particularly vulnerable during the siege. Some women and children fled the city with the Muslim army when it retreated, while others hid in basements or cisterns to avoid being captured by the Crusaders.\n\nThe Crusaders' treatment of common people in Jerusalem after the siege was mixed. Some were allowed to remain in the city, while others were forced to convert to Christianity or be expelled. The Crusaders established a community of Christian knights known as the \"Knight's Hospitaller\" to care for the sick and poor in Jerusalem, demonstrating some level of compassion for common people.\n\nOverall, life for common people during the Siege of Jerusalem was incredibly difficult and dangerous. The siege marks an important moment in the experience of common people during the Crusades, illustrating the terrible consequences of war and the challenges of survival during volatile times."}, {"question": "What are the origins of our time scale? When was it created, and how was it decided that time would span outward from what would be 'year 0'?", "answer": "There is not a simple answer to this question, and I'm not going to provide it. Very much the short answer is that there is a **long and complicated political history tied to the entire endeavor** of timekeeping \u2014  I would recommend Tolstoy's great tome regarding chronology - *Chronos: the form and stuff of time*, beginning especially Chapter II of J-K and Chapter III for your more pertinent issues.\n\nTolstoy in a good amount of detail while emphasizing the political components. Before a medium to record time became commonplace in the form of hourglasses, and later watches and clocks, the political and cosmological process of how to measure *time* remained undocumented. It should be noted especially that visible celestial bodies were intensely linked to religion and state *authority*; and the consistency of their movements meant that rulers and thinkers alike began to craft a complex and physical understanding of the way the universe 'worked'.\n\nThe concept of the Ticking stopped before at least 1582 BC, because the observable phenomena of 'day' and 'night' gave the necessity for keeping track of *time;* but the development of time was a more complex and arduous process. Note throughout this that I am **not trying** to imply 'time' and 'chronology' are equivalent concepts in a true and crisp definition, but that the physical measurement of time and subjective chronology are, at best, retrospectively linked to one another through the measurement of time.\n\n- `day` -   (cyclical sequence) houses the periods of 'night' and 'daylights' which *aren't necessarily* an objective measurement of time\n- `year` - (from the 'Display' Planetary Habits (Astronomia Aristotelica):  the latency between the rotation of the sun around every visible celestial body in the same relative position; \u00a0an astronomical concept restored from the physical observation of changing *angles* between bright celestial stars as the span of visible horizon rotated through time.\n\nThe actual annunciation of chronology is burgish amongst the battles of insight and hard sciences over how to understand and measure *time* in the abstract, and relies on the Ontological view of time as a extension of the universe, not as some gods-given and chief representation of time.\n\nI will try to summarize 'Chronos: the form and stuff of time', starting with the solid point at which time became an abstract \"concept of measurement\" and material'substance':\n\n---\n\n^(**Some conclusions and premises:** If we were still speaking of the cyclical period of 'day' it'd make more sense to say 'Time' and 'Chronos' were two different things. Or said differently, one might be more concerned with the *possession* of self-entailing bonds *in time,* as an interlacing current between past, present, and future.\n\nSide note: \n\n- The 'Ontological' deduction regarding time is based largely on the Academic recovery of forgotten words from uncuplated works, and seems to be reference the uninitiated of (as Tolstoy) ancient shadowy times whose imaginations cease to grasp the chronological precepts of observations which aren't life *events.*\n- Modernly, the 'Ontological' perspective appears to have found justification through becoming a 'phenomenological concept'; which is to say we are afforded that 'time' isn't some absolute concept, but is cultivated and made in intimate relation to living and memory. \n\n^(\"Chronos: the form and stuff of time\" p112, Tolstoy)\n\n)\n\nArrangement of this post as a descriptive'report' with some real 'time' perspective, feeling and praxis.\n\nI wrote my first draft of this answer in early 2018, and touched up on it. If you're interested in some of the broader stroke looks at what kind of convergence became the *screwball-like* time keeping we have now it will hopefully be reasonably informative", "baseline_answer": "The modern calendar and time scale that we use today have their roots in ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans. However, it was the spread of the Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE, that laid the groundwork for our current timekeeping system.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, made several reforms to the Julian calendar, including the skipping of leap years in certain centuries. This adjustment put us closer to accuracy, as the Gregorian calendar is now approximately 0.2 seconds ahead of astronomical time (meaning solar time, as opposed to clock time) per day.\n\nThe choice to measure time in centuries and years, instead of less concrete units like \"ages\" or \"eras,\" was likely driven by practicality. Centuries and years are easy to count and remember, and centuries in particular provide a useful framework for understanding the progression of history.\n\nThe decision to set \"year 0\" at the nil ante meridiem (11:59 p.m.) of December 31, -4713 BCE (or September 1, depending on which dating system is used) was made by Bishop Usuard in the 9th century. Usuard's \"Epact Cycle Calendar\" assigned a numerical value to each year, following the cycle of lunar months and solar years, and allowed picking a zero point for dating (and timekeeping). Today, most historians use a dating system with year 0 set at the time of A.U.C., or the ab urbe condita, or \"from the founding of the city\" (Rome, in this case). \n\nIn summary, the origins of our time scale are complex and rooted in both practicality and tradition. Centuries and years proved to be the most useful and memorable way to measure long periods of time, and the choice of which exact year or moment to designate as \"year 0\" was made based on various factors, including religious and historical symbolism."}, {"question": "How did women cover their hair in Europe (especially England) in the Middle Ages/Renaissance?", "answer": "Women didn't cover their hair with headscarves the way they do now, primarily because fabric-making was a skill in which they had little experience. They wore head veils and, in some cases, head coverings, but their primary purpose was as a show of humility and modesty rather than to make a fashion statement. This is one reason why many women displayed their hair as a point of pride; the other is that religion placed a great deal of importance on hair care. Hair care was important because the head was considered to house the spirit, and so certain rituals like daily washing and care were necessary to keep the spirit healthy.\n\nIn Medieval and Renaissance times, women wore a number of different hair coverings (hoidenluch); alum, eccho, quaker, and tawdie, for example. These ranged in style from the fairly open to the fairly closed.\n\nAlum: the Alum used to be very popular in the Renaissance. This very flattened hat was tied under the chin and wound around the head. This hat would cover your neck and forehead but had a small hole for your hairs to peek out. It would often be painted in silver or gold colors to give a fancy look, and often be made of black silk complimenting the aristocracy\u2019s red hair (which was far more common in Europe than one would think).\n\nEccho: The Eccho looks somewhat like a Bowl cut covered the head It is a very hefty and broad peaked cap (scarf). It was one of the earlier styles that fully covered the head while ventilating the scalp somewhat. They start to open at the top of the forehead. The opening at the forehead widened somewhat, and sometimes the back of the Eccho became only an inclusive band too.\n\nQuaker: This was a form of cap smaller than an alum, for many women in the mid at the END Renaissance, the quaker covered women and distressed women in general. Accessories for this particular loop of cloth were a bow of grosgrain lace or a bow of ribbons tied near the bottom. These looks would open at the bottom to reveal the plump hairpins used to tie back the hair, and this intentional fluttering of hair is a style done still today; called Bumpisty ends in French, or \u201ctopsy-turvy hair\u201d.\n\nAs the spirit-sensitive hair age started, women shifted their focus into accessories for their \u2018cover-up\u2019. A lace cap laid on top to separate the hair from skin; called Close Cap. French women tied this on top of the Almost Misenail headcaps, which were not sleeveless but had full sheet sleeves, as types of everyday dresses.

The type of headwear worn depended on factors such as social class, age, and the occasion.\n\nFor ordinary women, a simple walnut-shaped headdress known as a hennin or hattenyn was popular during the late Middle Ages. This headdress consisted of a tall, narrow headpiece with a rounded top, often adorned with a veil or netting. Hennins fell out of fashion in the 15th century, but similar headpieces remained popular among noblewomen.\n\nAs the Renaissance began, more elaborate headdresses such as the French hood (or \"barbara\") became popular. This hood-like hat featured a raised, pointed front with a veil or netting across the back. The French hood was often decorated with jewels, feathers, or other embellishments.\n\nIn the 15th century, the pomander headdress became fashionable. This striking headdress consisted of a circular, ornate frame tucked behind and around the head, often containing perfumes or scented balls. The pomander was occasionally paired with a hood or other veiled headpiece.\n\nAs the Renaissance progressed, headwear became less practical and more decorative. The \"kirkiner,\" a voluminous gown over a full skirt, was worn with an elaborate, wide-brimmed headdress known as a French mantilla. This headdress featured many layers of fabric, saying, and frills around the forehead and below the chin, and was meant to be seen as a display of wealth and status.\n\nIn the 16th century, the ruffled \"hen-nest\" headdress was a popular option for women. This headdress featured a tall, cone-shaped structure within a frame, decorated with feathers, ribbons, and other embellishments.\n\nAs necklines became more revealing towards the end of the 16th century, headwear also changed to accommodate the trend. Wide, flat headbands known as \"bands\" or \"bandeaus\" replaced elaborate cumbersome headdresses, and were often decorated with jewels, pearls, or other decorative elements.\n\nIn sum, during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, women in Europe (and England, in particular) covered their hair with a variety of headwear styles that varied by social class, age, and occasion. Initially, these headdresses were mostly functional, but as fashion trends changed, they became more ornate and decorative and served as symbols of wealth and status."}, {"question": "If women in Europe weren't seen as equal to men until the 19th century, why were some women given positions of absolute power? (Queens etc)", "answer": "I am not a historian and my main during BA and M Res was on medieval things, but in short this question asks two things (a) why were empresses or matrilineal rulers a thing in history and (b) if european women went from being invisible entities to gigantic enlightened super warriors, why bother about this in the first place. \n\nThe first question, it is false to imply that women were in any way not involved in power games and struggles. Just as much as any man in the middle ages, noble women (consorts, ladies-in-waiting, abbesses, etc) actually had very important tasks of their own, ranging for just keeping their women quiet to the actual roles of hand-printer of the kings, for example the show Henric van Valckenyse also known famously as \"The Hero of Westminster\", who did the job of the typist in the pages he wrote down to shortly before the coronation of Henry VI, was \"Empress Philippa\".  They either modelled the ideal femininity (which Queen Philippa was very known for) or they actually executed very powerfull men and actions (like for example the first countess of Blois, Countess Theobald of Blois  was such an influential political player that the local trick of brokerage and diplomacy they used made it possible for her son Louis VI to become king of france - and if my memory serves correctly her tales were the very proof of the qualification some were talking about under this thread about queens: if louis VI wanted to be king, he really better started to look after his mum's videogames, since the forces were so mighty that even the english collecting their corn or crowns or any resources seemed suddenly less important than dealing with the family issues of the french king. \n\nthese persons made strategic marriages and they tried to lift themselves in prime position or they could in some cases totally lead, this being her case know as her so strong family, mother Elisabeth of Blois didn't marry another noble person but actually started with Count Ralph I of Vermandois, and they were instrumental in another marriages of heirs of primogeniture, and after, after during crises or wars, a question you also fail to ask is if it was even possible to be on the throne without women. \n\nthese women were not only the pillars of the political game of their relations, but they also had their own careers and diplomatic missions, which they carried out on the side, or maybe even in cooperation with one of their men folk. The abbess Mahaut of Artois for example threatened to kill Peter of Savoy, since she considered him responsible for strengthening the french borders against her rule in a situation currently being researched about the prosperity of the lives of the family with the signs of a decline of the Artois late medieval nobility, and indeed he was shot down and died soon after these insults not reconciling themselves, Mahaut either surviving or being caught and executed soon after.\n\nthe second question this sets up is probably false question in the first place, because, as @Philippa S. Thacker talks in her article Becoming a Queen: Enacting royal identity through ritual and pageantry, it shows that if we are discussing about images we take on ourselves and how we execute them in our roles as a queen in modern times, people still feels the royal identity is just a personality trait that only honours the female sex. Last times that Queens were at least a superwoman in this specific context, we had Margrethe II of Denmark, queen of Norway, and Elizabeth II of the UK, both of them below a certain level of competence when it comes for example to going to the police, the legislative work, the control and the orders of court - but even this depends on the country's rule of monarchy. As the daughter of Ragnhild Haftj\u00e4r Brydgesstuen points out in her sticky from which I got this and the other topic about this, some countries allow their monarchs the exercising of the \"botesmann role\", while others do not, what does a Queen and am extra part in society is actually *just* her femininity, even if the people under her defence elevate her because of this femininity (and not regarding the office she took and the amount of power that partagion). \n\nthis is why there might have been highly capable women who ruled europe, or who really helped their kings, but a book which does address this", "baseline_answer": "The concept of \"equality\" between men and women during the pre-modern era is different from what we understand today. Medieval philosophy and jurisprudence recognized women as legal persons and allowed them to own property, inherit wealth, and bring legal action. However, they did not consider women to be equal to men according to the standards of the day. Men were generally viewed as the head of the household and society at large, while women were seen as subordinate to men. This belief system helped to institutionalize male domination and suppress women's autonomy, but it didn't necessarily exclude women from holding positions of power.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a woman could become a queen by marrying a king. The traditional role of a queen was primarily that of a wife and mother; she did not typically wield significant political power or influence in matters of governance. However, in exceptional cases, a queen could rise to the position of regent\u2014a woman who takes the place of a king during his absence. This happened, for example, during the minority of young kings or in the event that the king was incapacitated or killed. A famous example is Queen dowager Marie of Brabant, who acted as regent for her son, Philip the Good, during his minority in the late 14th century. In this context, women could exercise authority when legally empowered by circumstances\u2014not because they were inherently equal to men, but because they were filling a temporary leadership role.\n\nAnother route for women into positions of power was the religious sanction of female leadership. During the Middle Ages, some Catholic Church orders, like the Dominican and Franciscan, permitted women to take religious vows and live in convent-like communities. These religious women could hold property, teach, and govern the community, serving as abbesses or mothers general. However, in this context, women's religious power was ordained by religion, and it did not challenge traditional gender roles outside of their churches.\n\nIn monarchies with established lines of succession, women did not typically inherit the throne, and in those rare cases, she would often marry into the royal family to ensure the continuation of the dynasty. The last accepted female line of succession was that of the House of Stuart, in which Queen Mary II co-ruled with her husband, William III. This could be seen as a remarkable exception to the idea that women could not hold political power, but it was not due to any modern belief in female equality. Instead, it was because of the particular circumstances that led to William and Mary's joint reign. Following Mary's death in 1694, however, the House of Hanover (another Protestant dynasty with a claim to the throne) succeeded the Stuart monarchs and instituted a strict male-line of succession that continues to this day.\n\nIn summary, women could hold positions of power in specific circumstances, such as regency, religious leadership, or exceptional circumstances resulting from dynastic mismatches, but these actions never challenged traditional gender roles. These roles did not stem from an inherent equality between men and women. Instead, women's positions of power were curtailed by traditional gender norms, limiting their access to political influence and opportunity. The concept of modern equality, as it is understood today, only emerged with the Enlightenment's advocacy of individual rights and, subsequently, in response to the French Revolution."}, {"question": "Why did Native Americans in the present United States and Canada develop fewer permanent structures than other early civilizations?", "answer": "<|user|> Question: How come so many healthcare giants and computing giants are in California? (like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Apple etc)\nAnswer: The answer is actually way more varied than many people would generally assume. The person(s) / company with the best chance to explain this thoroughly would be a native Californian who has lived through the periods when these giants sprung up, particularly someone from Silicon Valley at the heart of it all.\n\nThere is going to be a struggle getting an answer since a person who lived through this would be a rare find but what could be done is reaching out to people based around Stanford University who might be able to provide you with the best explanation and also link up and interview some of these giants that are still around.\n\nWhile I can touch on aspects of it, concluding the answer would require responses from many different types of people.\n\nWhile startups and tech in the 21st century blew up in Silicon Valley, California did not start building this empire from there. It started off growing in the broad belief of opportunity and wealth in California due to the Californian Gold Rush in the 1800s and the fact that opportunities such as land ownership and accessibility to resources had bumped up analysis. Silicon Valley grew very rapidly through the 1940's, before when the entire Valley was largely a farm house community that would soon follow California's role in national defense development.\n\nStudying people around this time, like Julian Demers who became an Intel founder, would help bring understanding to why a particular group became ardent businessmen. Demers in his youth (drawn from interviews with him and writings about him) seemed compelled by exploration due to interest in adventure and fortune-hunting sense. Demers also took few class in computer science at his University but had a strong ability of logical thinking. Along his journey, he sold all sorts of things around Sonora such as clothing to prospectors he would provide pack animals to. Upon coming to Santa Clara with discoveries of Californian Gold mines becoming relatively well-known, Demers - while building a new sheep ranch - welcomed an engineer who was able to set up the first motion picture theater in Northern California. Demers would help this entrepreneur with shares left over and a deed to the land where the theater was. Soon enough, Demers was able to start the first gasoline-powered bus service in San Jose, then built what would become the first satellite location of a bank and two, large computer stores. It was in the 1950s that his daughter, Janis, took on an International Business Machines (IBM) computer and sold computer systems while he worked in investments before transitioning to Intel. Through his eldest son, Demers also was unsure of Colleges like Stanford and started a private one called Peninsula School with unique courses for students to attend that he felt were needed through youth. \n\nLarry Ellison often spoke of how getting the education he wanted was a struggle, driving him to react with aspiration quite differently than with an already paid for and comfortable education. While his early days may have helped start off the giant modern tech startups akin to IBM, HP and Intel, the foundation of Silicon Valley rested on government defense and use of nearby facilities. After World War II, seeing the economic climate of Silicon Valley develop, a lot more prospects of the state moved up North to enjoy not only California travel up the state but Oakland, which is in the center of the Bay Area, making commuting be a vital quality. This was a common issue with many college classmates of his in the early 1960s. \n\nA correct answer here would require first deciding what exactly you want to ask: How did business environments in California interact with these giants in how they expanded and grew us giant tech corps of today? Or were you asking how many computer giants in the 21st century were based out of California as opposed to the general, but always growing general West Coast?\n\nThe latter question is the impossible question. It's not that any other place is incapable of these established companies piling up in the West Coast area (Alabama does home Apple Computer, one could argue) but there were two things. The reach of the whole West Coast to flourish and distinguish among white collar choices compared to the East Coast. The second thing was the California Gold Rush which spawned a hard, economic work environment that lends itself to business startups (as early as the 1800s). Thus, the following which people correct us about answer why California suits well for these", "baseline_answer": "There are several reasons why Native Americans in the present United States and Canada developed fewer permanent structures than other early civilizations:\n\n1. Nomadic lifestyle: Many Native American tribes were nomadic, meaning they moved from place to place in search of food and resources. Permanent structures would have been impractical for these people, as they needed to be able to pack up and move quickly.\n\n2. Use of natural resources: Native Americans in places like the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest adopted a subsistence strategy focused on hunting, fishing, and gathering. They built temporary structures, such as tepees or wikiups, that could be easily dismantled and replaced as they moved from place to place. These structures were often made from natural materials like animal hides and grasses, which were readily available and could easily be replaced as they wore out.\n\n3. Environmental factors: Many early civilizations, like the ancient Greeks and Romans, built permanent structures because they lived in places with abundant resources. They had access to stone, timber, and plenty of food to support populations that could work on building projects for decades or centuries. Native Americans, on the other hand, often lived in environments that didn't offer the same resources. For example, the desert Southwest didn't have the resources necessary to build large, complex structures like those found in the ancient Near East.\n\n4. Cultural values: Some Native American cultures valued mobility and flexibility over permanence. The Anasazi, for example, built large complexes like the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde, but eventually abandoned them and moved elsewhere. This may have been due to changing resources, environmental factors, or cultural reasons related to feelings of overpopulation and resource depletion.\n\nOverall, the reasons why Native Americans in the present United States and Canada developed fewer permanent structures are complex and multifaceted. Nomadic lifestyles, an emphasis on natural resources, environmental factors, and cultural values all played a role in determining whether a particular group of Native Americans built permanent structures or not."}, {"question": "What was the reason behind the mass Soviet deportations of the Chechens, Crimean Tatars and others along the southwest frontier? Did anti-Muslim sentiment play into it?", "answer": "The deportations definitely played into Russians' prejudices against Muslims (and even Christians in the case of Crimean Tatars).\n\nBut at their base, they were a response to the perceived political threat of the SS-Himmler Ukrainian police and Schutzmannsubteilungen to the Soviet state. It was not something the Nazi's inherently thought of as targeting Muslims, but was instead a practical decision. All of the SS police fought in towns and cities and, in turn, Returned Internally Displaced Persons to Soviet and German occupied areas. \n\nThe problem in making it an ethnic cleansing campaign of Muslims or Jews, as opposed to Germans, is that the Germans didn't like the Soviet Army, which happened to be populated by Slavic peoples and Shoah survivors- dirt poor Jews and neighbors besides. Thus, in spite of Germany sympathizing with pogroms against Jews, the Holocaust became a genocide of Jews and having fulfilled this, most post-WWII Germans couldn't believe the Soviets would be guilty of immoral genocide of those other nomadic or forward-thinking populations that didn't hate Jews- You know, the Caucasians, Tatar, etc like the Chechens and Crimean Tartars.\n\nUkrainians, who made up most of the Nazi police compared nomadic peoples as the enemies not only of the Defenders of the Homeland but of Christmas and Holy Family and Jewish and Christian Societies in general. This differentiation implied that Moscow planned on threatening, if not outright destroying, Polish and Catholicist Christians in general just like Nazi German propaganda implied of Jews.\n\nIn turn, Stalin and the Politburo had hoped this would be a relatively obstruction free way of clearing the frontiers of Moscow's Union Republics of potential Nazi and/or Polonian influenced partisans or terrorists after the war ended. Many in Moscow (which included people in Crimea, Chechnya, the southern Caucasus) thought such purging would only be temporary, but found themselves surprised by the Soviet refusal to return these communities to their homes.", "baseline_answer": "The mass deportations of the Chechens, Crimean Tatars, and others along the southwest frontier of the Soviet Union were a result of several factors. One of the primary reasons was the belief by Soviet leader Josef Stalin that these ethnic groups posed a security threat due to their collaboration with Nazi forces during World War II. After the war ended, Stalin viewed these ethnic groups as potential enemies and decided to forcibly remove them from their homelands as a preventative measure against future rebellions and uprisings.\n\nAdditionally, Stalin saw the deportations as a way to consolidate Soviet control over the region and remove any ethnic groups that could potentially challenge Soviet authority. This was part of a larger policy known as \"population resettlement\" or \"forced migration,\" which involved moving peoples from one area to another to achieve various political, economic, and social objectives.\n\nWhile anti-Muslim sentiment may have been a contributing factor, it was not the sole reason for the deportations. Many of the ethnic groups affected by the deportations were not purely Muslim, and in fact, some of them were Christian or Eastern Orthodox. Rather, it was the perceived threat of collaboration with the enemy during the war, as well as the potential for rebellion and disloyalty to the Soviet state, that sparked Stalin's decision to depopulate these regions.\n\nSources:\n\n- \"Stalin's Crimes and the Holocaust\" by Norman M.

If so, were the results the same? Did the city recover?", "answer": "No.\n\nThe nearest parallel is probably the Aftermath of World War II. This affected all the main European cites, especially the bombed cities of war. It was such a dramatic change that what had been a massive, crowded center of commerce and government became nearly deserted because the population migrated elsewhere. Most cities either recovered almost full strength in 10-20 years, or plateaued at a much smaller size. Some never recovered (like Coventry, whose reconstruction efforts proved futile in a time of rapid urbanization and de-urbanization) For the older cities with many colonist suburbs, most heavily bombarded cities recovered in 2-3 year before their surrounding suburbs grew to take the city's place but in a different demography.\n\nJapan suffered less in terms of rebuild efforts than the European cities, and retained almost the same population after a few years of plummeting to under half its peak (and rebuilding), which only accellerated after even more effort during the Korean War. By the 1970s and 1980s the reconstruction had ended, and northern-american cities much more resembled the European examples than the asian ones who plummeted in population then just recovered after rebuilding.\n\nDespite the first two paragraphs alluding to this, the main downwards trend and the trend we are observing in cities today is not lack of population of minimal constructive inertia, but instead the existence of suburbs that want to keep independent and subsidizes any industry or commercialism. While some cities like Leiden or Paris have mitigated almost all of this trend through aggressive conservation, most cities were unable to do so because of public opinion, over-investment in the suburbs, and just some basic problems that create a significant public pessimism.\n\ncities that began the 20th century bustling with either commerce or factory work have seen this be phased out into outsourcing work, more significant regulation, and largely due to the first -- just downright doom as in Detroit. Some continental cities like Antwerp or Rotterdam managed to recover with their plentiful, novel commercial real estate phases. In most continental cities, infrastructure replacements caused a dip in demography resulting in recession. Instead of fixing up the new & older industrial district's facilitative infrastructure, the buildings in the cities proper phased out, creating an increasing depopulation and subsequent depopulation of the city(). Only a few larger cities managed to cling on to what, in plan, was their effective single real estate phase -- heavily built up storehouses on a tile-paved base. Most cities of Europe and later America have seen their populations plummet, including loss of all their exponential growth.\n\nDetroit was a city affected by de-industrialization. Most cities of the world either already endured or realize just before the creation of the United Nations that they should or were to be served by international treaties in order to survive, leading close to an economic restoration in order to implement a power and the ability to. In 2009 most cities had fixable economic problems, with regret to Detroit by 16-18 years of loss of population and loss of industry. Most international cities realized the sharp plummet in population could indeed be pitched due to the rise of the computer revolution. Thus, the although undefined consisted of restoration and acquired international business (which its member states nevertheless made agreements to *nothing* in terms of human rights' protection, unlike the international covenants that exist for the contrast), permission to restore part of state land to companies, and the acquisition of state-subsidized public power for the subdivided residents. As such, corruption and pathological conservativeism similarly plummeted and deindustrialized states in the capital and continental cores in the US were increasingly divided. In Detroit the situation was only aggravated by its white dumping efforts of the 1940s-1960s, loan-sharking Memphis-esque hedge funds of the 70's-1980sers decades (most categorically proven in a biography of Harley Davidson) and a conspiracy of corporate-suburb success in separating Detroit as equal.

The city has shown some signs of recovery in recent years, with lower unemployment and a growing population. 2) Flint, Michigan - The well-documented water crisis caused a 6% decrease in Flint's population between 2016 and 2017. While the city is working to address the water issues, the population decline continues, and redistribution of resources has made the already struggling city even more challenging to support. 3) East St. Louis, Illinois - Between 1970 and 2020, the city's population declined by over 75%. Like Detroit, East St. Louis experienced significant job losses, population migration, and urban decay. While the city has seen some small signs of improvement in recent years, the population decline remains significant, and the city's infrastructure still struggles to support the remaining population. Each of these cities experienced different factors that led to population decline, but in all four cases, those factors have contributed to urban decay, economic stagnation, and loss of infrastructure. Detroit's recovery has been the slowest and most extreme of the four cities mentioned, but none of these cities has thoroughly recovered from their population declines yet. Although, East St. Louis appears to be the most extreme decline among the four here with Detroit following very close behind them."}, {"question": "What was going on around the rest of the world while Europe was in its Dark Ages?", "answer": "Generally, the European Medieval Period (800AD+/-1000 years from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance) was an abnormal time. Relatively speaking, the whole world north of the Sahara was stagnating during the Medieval Period. \n\nThe rest of the world was still progressing. Asia was inventing paper and gunpowder, while intellectual knowledge was being improved. The political structure was working, the elites were happy, and the monarchy was still relatively new. Europe, on the other hand, was under major cataclysmic events and huge catastrophes, an accumulation of failures over time. The Rise of the Byzantine Empire as a center for learning should also be noted as an exception, though intellectual and technological civilization was still centered in the Middle East; they spoke almost universally Arabic and could sell their goods. And it is well understood that there was a considerable influence of Islamic mathematics in a variety of medieval European commentaries and textbooks, e.g. Algebra.\n\n\nDespite much research done during the past several decades of archaeological digging motivated by international prestige in Europe, there have been surprisingly only minor discoveries in western Europe during this time. The only'surprise' recent discoveries (all of which paled in comparison to what has been long known and accepted), and all of which have been small communities such that the period could have declined manifestly that there have been no new striking findings.  Most of the technology (iron crucibles, copper working), sculpting (Viking age, Tang, Graeco-Roman), and so on, had already been fully developed by the 1,200s that it is hard to expect that there could be drastic new findings that would raise brows. \n\nIn large part this explains why Europe during this time was a generally forgotten entity for so long. A number of books have been written by contrarians in younger years trying to push back against the economic pessimism of European Dark Ages scholars, e.g jcbse write On the Theoretical Inheritance of the Archaic Europeans, but most of the research on the 'Dark Ages' have gone far beyond this. \n\nDespite that many things have been written to the contrary in trying to locate the decline further south, whether you can believe that Far East (China) never had an intellectual decline remains a speculative issue, although obviously in private many prefer to look the past for theories absent any support. The Western European Dark Ages are a myth akin to the Legend of the Black Death. Nobody would deny that, in hindsight, naval regulatory declined and industry had begun to fail for many redundant reasons (ecological felling, changing trade patterns, war-fare and so on), but to reduce this as an all encompassing plague is incorrect as scholars are given to saying plague decreased the populations of China during the Tang. \n\nThe Wexler hypothesis made the case that some were casting Latin stones as written out by Greek literates but thanks to one 16th century archaeologist, Bernard I, Duke of Saxony, traveling across the land passing his findings to contemporary medieval scholars, the consistency of literacy and how it declined with record has been well matched in Asia and the EU. Who would counterwrite the claim coming in the all too common touch of China versus the EU? \n\n\nIn a way, China does have something which could scientifically discern that evidence, isn't that so there are the solid estimates of Chinese population declining. It should be mentioned that the medieval period did see a partial, though not near full, conquest of Chinese lands by foreign invaders. This issue is meant to mutually invalidate, using so many words to avoid drawing too much attention to a serious statement being made when the statement by Nebraska 20th state treasury of \"no means\" was used incorrect). Instead, it is used only to show how widely accepted the notion of the European Dark Ages is accepted beyond scholars in other fields.\n\nSo the question remains to e taken on at a much more cynical level on or after the millennial celebrations. How can one be dismissive of Chinese population decline and western European and Asian intellectual stagnation? The fact that there are too few excavations by reputed European scholars could mean that there are surprises in waiting.\n\nAnother issue is centralization, a method akin to the most recent method (patenting and financing structure) of keeping the large masses of people focused on a small amount of intellectual advancement that can be", "baseline_answer": "1.

It's a question we can't ask the ancient Egyptians, so what I'm going to do is provide some insight on the timing as well as some possible rationales for the choices the ancient Egyptians made in their mummification practice with regards to removing and preserving organs.\n\nLet's start with an attempt to answer your first question. When did the ancient Egyptians choose to perform mummification, and what were the forces driving that decision? The mummification technology developed during the breakup of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (about 1950 BCE - 1550 BCE). Mummification seems to be developed piece-wise. We know that the brain was removed first, probably while the body was still warm, but also several months after death. When the temples reestablished control over Egypt again, new laws were implemented concerning what bodies could be brought back into the temple proper to be mummified and buried in enclosed tombs. When the conquest of Egypt by the Hyksos became a temporarily till the mid 13th century BCE, laws against burial in developed tombs lapsed, for the simple reason that people could not afford to dig a proper tomb. These tombss had to be built and secured from the invaders, and priests were hired rather than compensated. This changes after the New Kingdom, and control over tombing is centralized again. Also, the mummification practises are instated rather than ad-hoc, indicating that they are official. This period also saw the installation of the cult of the Osirian gods, and due to this practice, extensive funerary necessities.\u00ac\u2020\n\nWhen the body arrived at the village or home of the deceased, the embalmers had to prepare them for transport to the closed tombs, which were much rarer outside the delta region. A standardized practice of embalming arose, giving us the prevalence we see.\n\nThe removal of organs served two different purposes: Prevention of decay and of withholding the smells from filling the tomb. During hot summer months, decay could start and officers would have to march to the funeral with two sets of curtains: One covering the biers, and the other, very detailed, being draped in the mummy space. You could smell nothing of decay, or so one hopes, but do smell the incense burning atop the pyramid. Another reason for embalming is a literal interpretation of the Book of the Dead, which states that, if you had your heart weighed on the Pleuton, which you do not get to bring into the afterlife, where you'd be judged by Ma'at for being alive or dead. The one would keep all his internal organs, and the other would undergo dismemberment (September Williams, 'Beautiful Horror,' Library of Alexandria lecture, 2016). The purging of the body may have been taken as an elaborate preparation ceremony to move closer to the dead Osiris, into the afterlife together with your social dynamism encoded in and tied to your gifts of people you took with you to the afterlife as companions. \n\nThese two reasons why remain of uncertain reality to us, however. Firstly, we have scenes of ancient Egyptians watching bodies emptying their stomach contents. Removal of the brain was done after death, however, and also, probably before the hot summer months when decay could occur.\n\nThe human body is pretty efficient at breaking down from where it sits. The reason why corpses in e.g. Steven Spielberg's *Saving Private Ryan* still look like fresh meat is probably due to modern handling, and not packing them with salt, and trying to make sure flies do not eat off the sensitive parts of the corpse in a decomposing body. No wimps on the battlefield, yo.\n\nThe act of mummification served also as a way to keep already embalmed members of the society, so they could be judged against Ma'at and see if they were worth, as a written evaluation, moving to the afterlife in permanent proximity with all of their possessions, having shuffled the mortal into the variegated sub-region of the afterlife, Akhet. \n\nThe embalming process was a long one. The corpse would be cleaned thoroughly first and then put into a pot.", "baseline_answer": "The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the seat of a person's intelligence and identity, and that it was weighed against a feather of truth in the afterlife during the ceremony of the Weighing of the Heart. They also considered that Id dreams and actions stemmed from the heart. Therefore, the heart was left intact inside the mummified body.\n\nIn contrast, the ancient Egyptians believed that the other organs, including the brain, liver, lungs, and intestines, could be removed and preserved separately without disrupting the person's identity or intelligence. This was done to withhold decay and prevent the body from looking unattractive, and to make it easier for the soul to recognize and reunite with the physical body during the afterlife. The brain was removed and discarded through the nose, as the soft tissue was easily crushed and blown out during mummification.\n\nOverall, the Egyptians\u2019 embalming techniques were a complex and intricate part of their cultural and religious beliefs, with individual organs being removed based on their perceived importance and during a specific timeframe in the embalming process."}, {"question": "What is the best way to learn about the American Civil War for a non-american?", "answer": "The best general introduction is Richard Carwardine's \"Bloody Strife.\" Despite the title (the Battle of Richmond Georgia) was no worse than many of the largest ACW battles.

I don't think this validation is fair, especially when we look at how the government operated.\n\nThe Mongols had no tradition of anything even vaguely like what Europeans would call government and bureaucracy until, really, the Ilkhanate in northwestern Iran. Here they introduced the qo\u1e6dbil, and some bureaucracy around the payments of the army, so that the empire would run less danger of fragmenting by economical mismanagement (duke Cornwell 2016, 135f).\n\nIn the vast Mongol empire, aside from a constantly transforming Central Asia and direct Mongol control over a relative share of Central and Eastern Asia, this state of affairs changed but little. Islam, on the other hand, became more important and formed a unifying factor for the individual khanats - as well as a strong factor for a more uniform administration over Islam, so that these khans became *de facto* Muslim leaders (ibid). \n\nThus, in the khanate of the Ilkhanate, long-term \"Khhazar Jews\" converted to Islam and formed a powerful \"Jewish network\" - the Jewish officials, officials that were \"imbued with authority / by [having] authority in the Christian East\" (art. Lemz:  *When the Diaspora Was Part of the Elite: Varieties of Jewish Leadership in the Ilkhanate*). Kkhotoids (Qara Khotids/Karakhotins) later (15th century) formed another group of influential and confessional intellectuals, great Armenians formed others (Taranath, mostly under Persia), and so did the Byzantines and their associated schismatic Eastern Orthodox orientation.\n\nCelebans (ceremonial staffs) and Valide Bans played a key role in the Ilkhanate; the Ilkhans changed the government and administration (*mac\u00e0s*) around 1280 heavily, and embraced Muslims and the Jordanian Ris\u0101la  - a guide on administration for Muslims and Islam, written in the period of Islam expansion.\n\nThe Ilkhanate, 1256 to 1335, became unusually powerful under Hulagu Khan (Halgaldeg/Ebi Halgal\u00ead\u00fc ogli!). \n\n\nBut when Hulagu died in 1265, Ghazan (the most powerful, undesired Muslim figure in the house, was only 25), there were already various strong factions of Muslims, Jews etc. And scholarship that could facilitate reform: Ghazan rose to leadership by deprioritizing the Celban system (to dismiss his debts) and then abolished the title and preserved the hated Mongol rule (Legge 1931, 47).\n\nThus, Ghazan changed the khanate somewhat subtly (although heavier than previous outwardly anti-Mongol Muslim rebel Khudabanda did. Ghazan's Qubilai Khan from Yuan Persia had been in talks as the emperor, but had no clear authority/power in Iran, while Ghazan was not even in the same category over Mongoly he dominated in Iran). \n\nAnother way in which the Mongols gained sovereignty was to oppose Mongold independence. When Mongke (Kublai) lost to rival Abagha (1260-1265), a new Ulus Turkistan took the place of the Ulus Chagatay and emerged under Berke Khan (1786-1706), when the tatars joined him; Berke also began Shite Islam, resulting in the Berke Khan even (again, since it typically rose to leadership as an outsider) dismissed Celbans and affiliated orphanages - because in politics, Charles Mongo \"A Mongol History of the World\" Diop's opinion, misconceptions can be used for benefit.", "baseline_answer": "The Mongols had significant control over their vast empire, which stretched from Eastern Europe to China and from Siberia to the Middle East. While their methods were often brutal, they established a highly centralized administration that facilitated communication, taxation, and military conscription. Some aspects of Mongol control included:\n\n1. An extensive bureaucracy: The Mongol Empire used a system of bureaucracy that relied on a complex hierarchy of officials. Each province was divided into smaller districts, with jurists, doctors, financiers, and administrators managing different aspects of governance.\n\n2. Standardized communication: The Pax Mongolica, or the relative peace maintained by the Mongols, was facilitated by standardized written scripts, as well as thorough roads and a sophisticated postal system.\n\n3. Economic regulation: Mongols taxed the conquered lands heavily and required all tributaries to pay tribute in cash or kind. The empire's enormous wealth created substantial opportunities for trading and investments in various urban centers.\n\n4. Military conscription: The Mongol army implemented a juried military service, which required all men between 25 and 60 years of age to serve part-time in the military. This conscription allowed them to maintain a powerful fighting force that could mobilize quickly.\n\n5. Justice system: The Mongols implemented a system of justice, headed by jurists, who oversaw all legal proceedings. Legal codes were standardized throughout the empire, and appellate courts dealt with cases that required higher levels of judiciary.\n\nHowever, what made Mongol rule unique was their willingness to tolerate religious differences. As successive Mongol rulers came from different religious backgrounds, they allowed the native religions to persist, as long as they did not pose a threat to the unity of the empire. This policy allowed religions such as Tibetan Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Nestorian Christianity to survive and develop under Mongol rule.\n\nWhile the Mongol Empire disintegrated in the years following Kublai Khan's death, the legacy of their system of governance can still be seen today in the form of various administrations in Central Asia, Europe, and Asia that emerged after Mongol rule."}, {"question": "Did US-backed coups in Latin America from 1945-1990 tend to have a positive or negative effect on the country's poverty, corruption, illiteracy, inequality, human rights etc? What about their economy?", "answer": "There are a lot of problems with your question, but let's try to pick out the most painful ones!\n\n1. *Which coups are you talking about?* You argue that *US-backed coups during 1945-1990..* But the violence in Latin America didn't end by 1990, so you're really probing the post WWII era). To begin with, not all the \"coup d\u00e8tat\" that happened in Latin America had US backing: many of them (in Brazil for example) were pre- (or around) WWII, making anti-Americanism an ideology of resistance against the governments that replaced democracy. Moreover, not all the governments that resulted from the coup (whether with or without US backing) have the same history either, and development scores depend on a lot of factors with which USA incidence is remote or not.\n\n2. *Comparative historical/development perspectives*. It all boils down to a comparison of before and after. Drawing a map with descriptors like \"poverty\", \"corruption\"; \"illiteracy\"; \"inequality\"; \"human rights\" automatically overplays some variables that you never took into account. Wasn't the life in Latin America's most impoverished areas much better than it used to under colonialism? For sure it was, and that's why contemporary observers label it poverty and underdevelopment in the first place - without exploring how a day in the life of 1850s peasants or slaves differed from that of a 1950s homeless person. It's a poor thing to consider, but very little attention is paid to expanding available centuries-long comparison (until and before the first US intervention in Latin America, for example). Moreover, like I stated before, human rights, poverty, corruption, inequality need to be contextualised for each context, amongst other things, their history with democracy; existing economic structures;  (often a slave owning) elite impact; religion (don't believe the official headcount, but the majority of Latin Americans are Catholics); and so on.\n\n3. *Theory vs nature*. Remembering truth-by-enumeration approach to counter your Mill's method, it could be incredibly problematic showing that Latin American developments were US-only products. The aura of US hegemonic interference does overshadow accountability in Latin America, but it can be quite far-fetched to hold the Yankee responsible for more than an appearance, sometimes given away too quickly, that can easily be awarded the \"cartoon effect\".\n\nI will alsoth address the bit about the economy, to thank your coordinated attack concerning the intercontinental development dynamics. From what I conclude out of this, 1945+ was a decent moment for economic sustainability, given the record least according to US supported republics, which are important because these are the \u201bstorage centers' of possible development in the eyes of American politicians and policymakers. IMHO, Latin America accumulated (picked up from post WWII have been a test my account) economic development far beyond what they have achieved at the very dawn of US intervention, expeccially from 1960s on.\n\nConcluding, one last observation: Between 2003-09, human development record in Latin America broke an intense sell off at the stock exchange. Also, continuous US support to the freely elected regimes of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia, the latter the biggest indigenous revolt of modern era in Latin America, one has to wonder that resisting US incursions could account in further promoting human development. And, all things considered, since 2010 they no longer hold that seat.\n\nI thought this essay was already difficult to construct due to overseeing of a large amount and trans-continental and temporal coordination and interdependence, but the issues debated end there. I examined the deviations but I won't care to face you, but I thank you for the civility that we've reached an end to the possibility of an unending discussion.\n\n*****\n\n*Comparison and causality are less regarded methods of approach in academic work, although they help to give patterns and continue populist ideology.

Here are a few points to explain this:\n\n1. Poverty: While the coups may have removed popular, left-wing governments that were seen as a threat to US interests, the new regimes often implemented neoliberal economic policies that hurt the poor. Austerity measures, privatization, and deregulation came at the expense of social programs, which deepened poverty in many of these countries. For instance, in El Salvador, the 1991 ceasefire agreement that ended a brutal civil war included a commitment to improve social conditions, but the government's implementation was inadequate, leading to high unemployment, poverty, and inequality.\n\n2. Corruption: The coups often installed corrupt dictators and regimes that undermined democracy and transparency. Leaders like Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza Debayle and Honduras's Roberto Suazo Cordovo were accused of widespread corruption, human rights abuses and electoral fraud, which damaged their countries' institutions and economies.\n\n3. Illiteracy: Many of the countries subjected to US-backed coups had already made significant strides in education, but these gains were often reversed by the new regimes. For example, in Colombia, the 1953 coup led to a cut in the education budget, resulting in a significant increase in illiteracy.\n\n4. Inequality: Neoliberal economic policies imposed by the US often led to a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, while working-class and peasant sectors suffered. This contributed to increasing inequality and social polarization, which in turn imbalanced these countries' economic and social fabric.\n\n5. Human rights: US-backed coups led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly in the context of counterinsurgency tactics. Governments often cracked down on opposition and human rights activists, leading to political polarization and violent conflicts that inflicted acute harm on affected societies.\n\n6. Economy: Most of these countries suffered from stark economic underdevelopment due to imperfect market structures, lack of infrastructure, and shady political governance. In many cases, the advent of the foreign-based multinational corporations and the leverage they had in these economies compounded this problem further.\n\nIn conclusion, the US-backed coups from 1945-1990 had largely negative effects on Latin America's poverty, corruption, illiteracy, inequality, human rights, and economy. These policies often resulted in political instability and protracted violent conflict \u2013 a common danger to societal welfare.

This would result in a worker\u2019s paradise, where work would expand to fill all personal interests, no one would want for anything or have to work anymore, and there would be no more social classes.  It's kinda a utopia for the proletariat. \n\nThis is where it goes wrong. The proletariat in Marx\u2019s writings were the bottom of society so they must have been a pure mass of working class \u201ccommunists\u201d.  But in reality most of the communist movements (including the Bolsheviks) were narrow and power hungry elites motivated by ideology. In practice, such as the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the proletariat did not overthrow the bourgeoisie, but actually ended up forming their own elite.  At some point these elites decided they didn't want a worker's paradise anymore, and decided they want to be on top of the super rich, knowing they can't be assured a place in the future worker's paradise. \n\nSo after the revolution the communist movement, including the Bolsheviks, sought power mostly by feeding off the fear of this same elitist system they were supposedly trying to overthrow in favor of the average Russian. This brought them to do exactly the opposite of what Marx wrote: during the Russian Civil War, they actively fought to maintain their power, and defend workers in the factories over workers who were fighting the Bolsheviks. Also at the end of the Civil War, and also following the formation of workers' organizations the Bolsheviks took land rights into their own hands leading to the enactment of a\u00a0policy known as Agrarian Reform Act of 1918. They were basically in favor of redistributing land in a way that guaranteed support of the Bolshevist government. \n\nThese actions that flew in the face of Marx, showed true to form what happened when the radicals of the left take themselves into the machinery of the state.  They have the utmost ability enact\u00a0\"forcing\"\u00a0their beliefs despite their claims of using revolution for \"workers control\"\u00a0and direct democracy.  The Marxist writings in response to the Bolsheviks Anti-democratic Deeds wrote against the\u00a0Bolsheviks, arguing,\u00a0\"To say of the Soviets that they have to recognize the demands of the Hungry, is to say nothing at all.

However, the form of communism as it was implemented in Soviet Russia and China under the leadership of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, respectively, diverged significantly from these ideals.\n\nThere are several factors that contributed to the transformation of communism into a totalitarian ideology:\n\n1. Lenin's interpretation of Marxism: After Marx's death, Vladimir Lenin interpreted his ideas in a more radical and authoritarian way. Lenin saw revolutionary violence as a necessary part of establishing communism, and he advocated for a small group of dedicated party members to seize and maintain power. This created the basis for a one-party state.\n2. The need to modernize: In the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Civil War, the newly formed Soviet Union faced immense challenges in rebuilding its economy and society. Communism became a means of modernizing and industrializing the country, requiring the implementation of centralized planning and strict control over the population. Political repression became a necessary evil to maintain order and social stability.\n3. The Cold War: The global power struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States, known as the Cold War, further intensified the need for authoritarian rule. The Soviet government saw itself as a counterpoint to Western capitalist forces and portrayed itself as the vanguard of the global struggle for socialism. This mission required a strong central state that could withstand external and internal threats.\n4. Nationalism and decolonization: In the aftermath of World War II, decolonization movements swept across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many new states emerging from colonial rule saw communism as a means of achieving national liberation and social justice. However, these movements often took on a nationalist and authoritarian character, as leaders sought to consolidate power and fend off external threats.\n5. Maoism: Mao Zedong, the leader of China's communist revolution, sought to create a unique variant of Marxism that would be well-suited to the specific challenges of Chinese society. Maoism emphasized the importance of peasant revolution and self-reliance, and downplayed the role of industrialization and centralized planning. This led to a more radical and decentralized form of communism that was closely linked with nationalism and popular mobilization.\n\nIn sum, the transformation of communism into a totalitarian ideology was a complex and multifaceted process, shaped by a variety of historical and ideological factors. While Marx's vision of communism was rooted in principles of social justice and equality, the implementation of these ideas in practice proved to be far more complicated and contentious."}, {"question": "In pre-modern warfare (1700s-1800s) why did ship-based cannons usually have a longer range than land-based artillery?", "answer": "1) Naval versions of guns were used to fight against *other* ships, whose armor would be thicker than most land fortifications. Can you aim a 32 pounder at a wall 10ft thick or a ship 1ft thick? *Hai*.\n   This is similar to battleship guns on land: they were built to smash through other tank armor and anything else would just be seen as fortuitous \"splash damage.\" Throughout the 1860s-70s, the development of railroads meant so many *other guns and shells* were pointed at the same wall 10ft thick as the 32 pounder.\n\n2) Even when gunnery was not directly targeting another vessel, sea has almost no topology, making aiming easy. Ships had predictable directions of travel, which was useful when trying to hit a moving target. Nowadays, tactics to deny the enemy knowledge of your position has more value, rather than outright being out of the firing range. Similarly, ships that didn't know where the other ship was can target and sneak around the enemy via gun-fire chance meetings. Just using sails to avoid hitting each other doesn't work very well: crossing carries a risk, tacking leaves you vulnerable.\n\nSailors defending forts built multiple 10ft+ thick walls with guns in between, a small fleet could just sail English Channel up and down trying to smash the whole thing, so strong forts had to be built along with smaller, weaker walls. Land based artillery is less calaventarian but more disputatious as military dictates and led on a command structure of conscripts. Grid-like \"strategic\" operations aren't worth their terrible results and as a result, there are very few. At sea, battle continuity offers a better knockout result, particularly when tactics change.\n\nHope it made some sense.", "baseline_answer": "In pre-modern warfare (1700s-1800s), ship-based cannons often had longer ranges than land-based artillery for several reasons:\n\n1. Height: One of the primary reasons for this is height. Ships are raised off the ground, allowing gunners a higher trajectory and more distance between the gun and the target. This height provides additional range due to the empirical relationship between range and trajectory angle.\n\n2. Decks: Additionally, ships had multiple decks, and their cannons could be positioned throughout the ship. Deckhands could aim the cannons over the side of the ship or from above, providing further distance and height to the projectile.\n\n3. Deck Movement: Ships also had the freedom to move. They could sail upwind or crosswind, launching cannonballs at their desired targets from a distance. Captains could also make use of the wind, aiding them in delivering longer and more accurate shots.\n\n4. Fortified Targets: In contrast, land-based artillery could not benefit from these advantages. They were restricted by terrain and location, often lacking the height necessary to deliver constant distance shots. Additionally, fortified structures like castles or forts could defend themselves against artillery more effectively than a moving fleet.\n\nThese factors resulted in ship-based cannons having typically longer ranges than land-based artillery in pre-modern warfare. It was easier for seafaring armies to maneuver and aim from out at sea than for land-based armies who had to work their way uphill or against fortified defenses."}, {"question": "What part did places like Africa, the Middle East, India, and South America have in World War 1 and 2?", "answer": "**Africa**\n\nPre-World War 2, the major powers only had small colonial possessions in Africa, and so while they made *some* military efforts there, it was not a major focus.\n\nDuring World War 1 there was a Southwestern African campaign, also known as the South West Africa Campaign, that started in 1914. It was an attempt by Germany to take territory elsewhere in Africa to serve as possible bases to launch attacks on South Africa. British troops, with South African reinforcements, defeated Germany's South West Africans.\n\nThe major campaign in African occurred in Tanganyika (which is now part of Tanzania and Uganda), alongside Burundi (which is now called Rwanda) and Rwanda (both being now countries of today). A British, French, and Belgian force defeated Imperial Germany's African forces in the East African campaign, and thus Germany was forced to sue for peace 2 weeks earlier than they would have otherwise.  Also, there was an ill-fated attempt by South African troops in the Cameroons to capture the German colony without British assistance, known as the Cameroons Campaign. The troops suffered from severe weather personally, and it failed before the fighting could even start. \n\nThe only real effect Africa had on World War 2, however, was the British Empire's efforts to benefit by absorbing Japan's holdings in Asia to instead hold themselves, to ensure that Japan would be unable to attempt any further aggression. \n\n**Middle East**\n\nThe Middle East was dominated by two major players in World War 1: the Ottoman Empire (which was an ally of Germany) and the British Empire (which was an ally of France). To attain victory in the war, the British Empire decided to involve another major world empire... the Russians. The two major sides got to the Middle East before the invasion of France by Germany would begin. After a failed attempt by British forces to take the Gallipoli (Turkey) beaches (commanded by ANZAC forces from Australia and New Zealand) were evacuated in 1916.  Eventually, in November of 1917, the Ottoman and British forces agreed to terms so that Syria could be handed over to France and Jordan would be handed over to the United Kingdom. France also ended up receiving Kirkuk as a concession for entering the war as well.\n\nFrom the World War 1 period on, the Middle Eastern countries were divided up by the 3 main world powers (France, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union). There would, in the future, be many wars originated or fought in the Middle East continued with incessant cause of coups and invasions, so this should prepare you for all of that content later on.\n\nDuring World War 2, the main desert victory for a major World War 2 power was the Battle of El Alamein in North Africa, where the British under Montgomery defeated the German Afrika Korps.\n\n \n\n**India**\n\nAs the UK was run by Britain, but operated its own affairs when administered separately in the British Empire, it remained loyal to its ally as most territories of the empire would. The WW1 campaign in India would be centered upon the Persian Campaigns, in which Persia, now Iran, was captured.  Afterward, the British were able to observe the security of the oil pipeline that they had found intricate value to. The Kurdish Campaign in Mesopotamia, the British Empire attempt at controlling modern day Iraq, was a major part of this endeavor after the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nIndian politics included an epic partitioning that occurred after 1947, which divides India between northern India, Pakistan, and southern India.\n\n\n\nI can't speak to what would be covered in more detail regarding South America.

North Africa: North Africa became a battleground in World War II as the Allies attempted to push the Axis powers out of the region. The British fought several engagements against Vichy France in Libya, culminating in the famous battles of El Alamein. The Allies also invaded and liberated North Africa from Axis occupation during Operation Torch in 1942, effectively cutting off the Axis supply lines to their armies in Europe.\n\nMiddle East:\n\n1.

This region became a British Mandate after the war and eventually gained independence in 1932.\n\n2. Suez Canal: The Suez Canal was strategically important during both world wars as it provided a vital shipping route between Europe and Asia. Control over this canal gave significant strategic advantages to the countries that possessed it during both wars.\n\nIndia:\n\n1. British Empire: India was a British colony during both world wars, and its vast resources and manpower proved crucial to the Allied war effort. Over two million Indian soldiers fought in World War I, including the legendary Indian Army unit, the 16th (Irish) Division, which defeated the Ottoman Empire at the Battles of Hill 60 and Babuna. In World War II, a significant number of Indian soldiers fought in the Pacific and European theaters, and over 65,000 Indian soldiers lost their lives.\n\nSouth America:\n\n1. Neutrality: South American countries generally managed to stay neutral during both world wars, enabling them to avoid involvement and the negative consequences of war. However, the British and Americans used some South American ports as supply hubs during their campaigns against the Axis powers in Europe and Asia.\n\nIn summary, while some African, Middle Eastern, Indian, and South American regions played a direct role in the two world wars, others maintained neutrality.

Was \"voice voting,\" accurate and secure? Were people subject to intimidation? Was it an effective and fair system?", "answer": "I don't know anything about America (with the exception of all the Answers I've given, somehow) but I can try to answer your first question with some studies in British parliamentary roll-call voting. Without getting too nerdy on parliamentary procedure, verbal votes in the Commons *are* (or were, I surveyed them in 1329 and 1559-60) electronically recorded and should demonstrate accuracy.\n\nWithout much surprise, you must instead consider whether everyone involved pleased the result. Hint: no. Contestants and their allies can cry \"noise!\" if they believe it's too hard to discern the results of the lords' calls - that means, the speaker probably asked the tellers to read off the totals. The speaker's reports of \"division aye 82 nay 13\" or \"division carried in affirmative 226 to 89\" are recorded despite the entire audience shouting out, ostensibly both at once&mdash;but if the ayes are being loudly favoured, that tends to mean they win. There are more sophisticated methods to try to quantify this, but I can't do it justice.\n\nI should speak to the issue of intimidation. It's well-known that the speaker of the house (or 'Speaker of the Lords' or 'chairman' for different types of houses of parliament) can be influential in swaying the vote. Lord Norreys was mentioned in Bentham's \"Jus Politicum\" as someone to quote as an authority about lawmaking. For obvious reasons, he was discredited in the eyes of politicians and voters. Norreys was impeached in 1572 and sentenced to almost 10 years in prison for committing nuisances like disorder in parliament, damaging its reputation, bribing with offices, and draining the crown's income. It was incredibly influential for him to there be a form and process for several parliamentarians to act to discredit him. In England at least, 'him' was 'his Majesty the king' and Norreys was here upholding a similar parliamentary statute. Based on the story going on right now regarding our president elect, it's not hard to imagine such a model of 'intimidation&mdash;but from parliament, not a scuffle at a Washington rally. We can't look at it from too party political perspective though, else we'd see the unchecked reining in of those who sought royal favour in parliament. Think about how we pit the 'consensus' democratic Clintonian party ideology as favoring 'free believe' ideologies. It would be an example of the projective psychology to assert that similar ideological factions in parliament favoured and competed for the 'free believe' as parliamentary office holders.\n\nWe can't look back and therefore know whether the mood of the day was uniformly democratic or uniformly conservative. Not to unceremoniously suggest the two Athenian politicians in Aristophane's 'Frogs' &mdash; its argument picked for selective quotation by many modern authorities like Plutarch, on the two most popular (Hippias, Pitocles to emphasize the differences with Dionysius how the brilliant Pastoors has determined) &mdash; to push that hideous democratic strategy the one in whose monodeclamative'symposium/ag\u014dn' (whichever way we read it, display of learnedness or display of knowledge, phron\u0113sis or skill in debate&mdash;it's a bit thought of two sides of learned coin in turn) Plutarch [57] shows is more capable rhetorically than the one is who more easily impresses the audience not with his speeches or his knowledge of democracy but with hot sauce on highest display. I often joke about the gullibility and prejudice of so many historians when I see modern talk (especially European modern at that) on \"Athens the birthplace of democracy\". Much like celebrity marriages and children born not as 'community children' but as men of the wild but to their fathers they are 'bastards of' Athens, Aaron loves to berate the baby-daddy of his 'Athenian democracy' children. Which is the best a negotiator can do, when his argument bends that this is not what the", "baseline_answer": "\"Voice voting,\" or the practice of announcing one's choice aloud in public settings, was used in a variety of contexts well into the late 19th century. While it may have been effective in some circumstances, such as in small meetings where everyone knew each other, it had several significant drawbacks when it came to election processes.\n\nAccuracy:\n\nOne of the biggest issues with voice voting for elections was its accuracy. In crowded and chaotic settings, such as those found in political gatherings, it could be difficult to hear all of the voters' choices clearly. Moreover, political opponents might try to shout out themselves in favor of their preferred candidate in order to throw off the counting process.\n\nUsually, the person responsible for tallying the votes would ask each voter to enunciate their choice twice, which might help to mitigate some of the potential inaccuracies. But this could still be confusing, particularly in the event of a close election or when voters were speaking over each other.\n\nIntimidation:\n\nAnother concern with voice voting was the potential for intimidation. In some cases, voters might be discouraged from speaking out loudly enough, particularly in the presence of more dominant or boisterous individuals.\n\nAs a result, it becomes harder to assert that contests administered by this means were 'free and fair' since the possibility of voters being deterred from speaking up, or even being compelled to vote in a particular way, could have skewed the results.\n\nEffectiveness:\n\nWhile voice voting could be a somewhat effective system in smaller, more intimate settings where everyone on hand knew one another, it became less reliable as the number of voters involved in the process grew.\n\nThis problem isn't merely a function of noise levels, either. There\u2019s research that demonstrates that, as group sizes grow, individuals collectively lose their ability to effectively screen and identify threatening individuals, which could very well apply to large public gatherings linked to political campaigning and elections.\n\nUnder the most stressful and charged political circumstances, this reality could cause either a significant exceeding in noise or lead to situations where a select few people overshout and displace others\u2019 input in the proceedings. Returning to our original question, then, the effectiveness of voice voting would seem to diminish with size and scale. \n\nFairness:\n\nFairness is also critical to the lexicon of credible and legitimate elections, and voice voting, in light of the above, does not seem to advance this cause. \n\nIn settings where voters' credentials, or their right to vote, aren't unambiguously known, then potentially the system could encourage manipulation and other maladies. There's also the potential of a substantive pretend voice voting case, where popular support is manufactured within a party or perhaps an interest group attempting to engineer the direction of their preferred candidate's momentum. \n\nMoreover, in places where there's a sizable number of bilingual, adult immigrants, refugees, and people with disabilities, where clear and consistent communication isn't the norm, the practical implications of voice voting might become even more obstructive and challenging to apply fairly.\n\nOverall, while voice voting did play a role in election processes up until the late 19th century, it was limited, inaccurate, and open to significant drawbacks as the size and complexity of elections grew over time. Today, our sophisticated, digital technology, and innovations in voting processes present alternatives to the old-fashioned system."}, {"question": "Why did Ireland and Wales never manage to create a unified kingdom while England and Scotland did?", "answer": "First of all, unified Ireland never happened. Ireland was often controlled by events and politics outside of Ireland. The native gaeilic kingdoms varied wildly in size and power, and some smaller ones never did much more than have effective local rule. \n\nThat said, Ireland was relatively unified during the Hiberno-Norman conquest, and even when Ireland was forcibly acquired by the English.

Timing: England and Scotland managed to unify at a time when Ireland and Wales were already subject to larger political entities. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had started coalescing into England by the time of the Norman Conquest, and Scotland had also begun the process of unifying by the time of the Bruce Wars in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Ireland and Wales, on the other hand, remained largely independent until the late medieval and Tudor periods.\n\n2. Geography: England and Scotland are separated by a stretch of water (the Irish Sea) that makes it easier to defend against invasion. Ireland and Wales, on the other hand, are connected by land, making it easier for smaller political entities to contend against larger ones.\n\n3. Sociopolitical factors: The formation of England and Scotland was facilitated by their Anglo-Saxon and Celtic roots, respectively. The English kings were able to forge a sense of nationhood and identity that transcended local loyalties, while Scottish national identity was rooted in Gaelic culture. Ireland and Wales, on the other hand, had a more diverse and complex mix of Gaelic, English, and Welsh traditions. This made it more difficult to forge a unifying identity.\n\n4. Politics and leadership: The historical figures who led England and Scotland to unification, such as Alfred the Great, Edward I, Robert the Bruce, and James VI, were crucial to their countries' success. Ireland and Wales did not have such strong and unifying figures at the time.\n\n5. Violence and Conflict: The unification of England and Scotland was accomplished by a process of conquest, while Ireland and Wales were subjected to less violent and forceful means of integration. This may have had an enduring impact, with Welsh and Irish national identities becoming stronger over time due to a history of rejection or resistance.\n\nAll these factors combined to make it more difficult for Ireland and Wales to achieve unification, particularly in the face of English and Scottish attempts to colonize or assimilate them.

It's believed that the native populations have had typhus since initially adopting \"European\" farming methods, from which San Francisco is believed to have acquired it.\n\nGiven the various Typhus theories, the question becomes; why was it present in native populations?  \n\nHere's my take on the difference between the responses to the Europeans, based largely on historical examination of the same situations in different locations.\n\n1.)

The violence is \"much more clearly defined.\"  People don't go to war \"for peace;\"  they go to war because there is a clear definition of hostility and aggression.\n\n3.) For indigenous populations against the Europeans, I have to guess that the people were forced into the military before being accepted into different social classes or, to borrow a really bad analogy, the society.

This would be analogous to insufferable ROTC joke, \"Do you want to learn how to be a doctor?

He offered a variety of ethnohistoric, archaeological, and linguistic evidence in support of his thesis.\n\nOne piece of evidence he introduced was the accounts of Native Americans reacting to the arrival of Europeans. According to Ireland, some Native Peoples did not initially react in terror or confusion at the sight of Europeans, as one might expect, but rather seemed to recognize them as familiar.\n\nFor example, Ireland pointed to the story of De Soto's expedition through present-day Georgia in the 1540s. Some of the Native Peoples the party encountered, known as the Cherokee, reportedly addressed the Europeans in a language that they could not understand, and then proceeded to trade with them. The party's chronicler, Garcilaso de la Vega, recorded these interactions in his historical account, \"La Florida.\"\n\nIreland also cited the reaction of the Huitzan Indians of the Yucatan Peninsula in present-day Mexico to the arrival of Europeans. According to Ireland, the Huitzan welcomed the Spaniards, calling them \"cousins\" and addressing them in a language that the Spaniards could not understand. These examples, as well as others that Ireland presented, led him to argue that these Native Peoples may have had prior contact with other peoples from across the ocean.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all Native accounts of European contact are consistent with Ireland's interpretation. Some Native Peoples did indeed react in terror or confusion at the arrival of Europeans, especially as the encounters often led to violence and displacement. Additionally, the accounts of European chroniclers themselves are not without controversy, as some have cast doubt on the reliability and accuracy of their reports. \n\nOverall, while there are certainly examples that suggest some Native Peoples had prior knowledge of Europeans, the evidence is far from conclusive, and the nature and extent of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact remains a subject of ongoing debate and investigation among scholars."}, {"question": "What are some good counter-examples to the notion that Classical Antiquity and the Renaissance were more 'civilised' or 'advanced' in comparison to the alleged barbarism and ignorance of the Middle Ages?", "answer": "The positive view of the Renaissance and Classical Antiquity is generally predicated on three major errors. The following is by no means a counter argument to medieval brutality, but merely some evidence against which their supposed superiority might be considered critically.\n\n1. Revolving around a shared cultural subtext and social orientation: It is often a problem that binds the comparison of the Renaissance and Classical Antiquity. Margaret Thatcher, a barbarian as per usual standards, is imagined as an unnecessary interloper into the modern world. Modernity ends in the renaissance, and the socialism was already in its pockets by the time the Europe was conquered. The case that is made that the Renaissance is superior to the Middle Ages is therefore to not take the medieval age seriously as a time worth capturing. Yet though personally I fail to understand why most prefer to spend their sacred reveleries to someone else's ideals rather than their own, it stands that there was considerably more medieval political culture (from the early French Constitutions, to the Khorsabad Tablets) than Classical.\n\n2.

For instance, the community represented in lobbying for Marble Revival was a minority, as while people set up for this, funded only pieces that do not muster configurations that bring about a true appreciation of the socioeconomic fabric. Capitalism and competition has always been solidified in the classical ideals (lorenzo decentralized the Fugger society in a new mode of economic relations generally cast to be significant but Gregory Klaus advanced with samurai-operated 'credit relations' in his essay *Staatenmacht, Fuhrerstat, Corporatim and Neokameralismus*). Critics in the political in the mediev era play a significant role of explaining society's slow generative progress with the enormous shifts which were significant psychological, just as in many ways they happen today in dissolve of an entire technological order, and were subsequently (see Volgode) tampered with or suppressed (at Nicea for instance). \n\n3. Critical reading: renaissance meant a revival of what was new, and what was distinct is it that the renaissance meant the creation of renaissance - i.e. Emmanuel Hamonner, the grandmaster, evidently pioneered the project throughout the Muslim world and also the majus. The so-called adoption of Egypti by Alexander the Great was in fact for the first time a true way to renaissance, though the southernness of Egypt or rather the alphabet had been considered in the excavation of the Greek and Egypti Early culture revolving around the west had transformed the Greek culture, this of classicism especially developed in the south(and one can trace ties of the capitalist slave culture in aching in the scathing bed of capitalist asceticism), thus the 'already-in' character of the renaissance does away the classical grandeur. In this sense for instance e.g. An Egyptian named Damon acting as impetus behind Tristan & Isolde was no less significant than the grandfather of Egypti Alexandre Duval, who supported Islamic scholarship and was the grandson of S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. The Middle Eastern Arabic is thus a power that moves beyond renaissance and leads the classical idea, until we start looking in how much the west and renaissance owes to Cairo. The Renaissance, as a culture of the cultural uproar of classical philosophy to sustain the existential support of the cultural mayhem in  south only comes to analyze closely these affectations and rejections.\n\nThe studied medicine, anthology", "baseline_answer": "1. Preservation of Classical Knowledge: While it's true that many classical texts were preserved during the Renaissance, it was actually during the Middle Ages that much of this knowledge was salvaged and preserved through monasteries and universities. For example, the monastery of Monte Cassino preserved texts from Pliny the Elder, Virgil, and Cicero during this time. Charlemagne's court also played a role in preserving classical learning, as he supported the translation of Greek and Latin texts into Latin.\n\n2. Inventions and Innovations: The idea that the Middle Ages were a time of stagnation and ignorance is inaccurate when we consider the many inventions and innovations that emerged during this time. For instance, the printing press, a vital step in disseminating knowledge, wasn't created during the Renaissance but during the 15th century. In addition, the development of long-distance trade networks during the Crusades facilitated the spread of new technologies such as paper-making to Europe from the Islamic world.\n\n3. Philosophical and Scientific Advancement: The notion that Renaissance philosophers and scientists made all the breakthroughs is an incomplete picture. Many philosophers, such as Robert Grosseteste in the 13th century, made notable contributions in physics, optics, and mathematics that laid the foundation for later scientific achievements. Similarly, medieval scholars such as Leon Battista Alberti and Johannes de Sacrobosco made significant contributions to mathematics and astronomy during the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n4. Humanistic Sensibilities: The idea that medieval society lacked humanism ignores the medieval scholarly tradition of humanist theology. Certain individuals, such as Thomas Aquinas, adopted a humanistic approach to theology, incorporating aspects of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy. Moreover, medieval people demonstrated an appreciation for art, literature, and music. For example, the beautiful stained-glass windows of medieval cathedrals prove that in terms of aesthetics, there's little separating the Middle Ages from the Renaissance.\n\n5. Religious and Cultural Legacies: The 'barbaric' attitudes towards religion and culture during the Middle Ages belittle the lasting legacy of medieval culture and religion. For example, the scholasticism developed by medieval intellectuals such as Thomas Aquinas had a considerable influence on later intellectual traditions. Similarly, Medieval religious sensibilities contributed significantly to the formation of the Western church, which in turn sparked humanism in the modern period.\n\nIn summary, while there's no denying that Renaissance thinkers and artists made significant contributions, the notion that all the highlights of intellectual, artistic, and scientific evolution belonged to the Classical Antiquity and Renaissance eras is flawed. By identifying these counterexamples, we can better appreciate the intellectual richness, cultural complexity, and scientific innovation that occurred during the Middle Ages."}, {"question": "Why did Nazi Germany treat Ukraine like a captured enemy, while most Ukrainians saw the invasion as a liberation from the USSR?", "answer": "\ufeff\n<|REDDITQA|> Question How did Olmec writing contribute to the maturation of CA?\nAnswer: \ufeff\n<|REDDITQA|> Question What caused earlier Greek and Roman societies to develop philosophical ideas like Platonic forms and Stoic values long before they had the need for them?\nAnswer: In no particular order, here are some ideas that may help:\n\n1. There's a line in the Alcibiades I by Plato that goes something like \"many things in men are turned around; some follow the form of something they have learned and some what they find in nature.\" This is why doctrines like the Platonic Forms could form so quickly; long before Plato (or Pythagoras, or whoever we choose to give credit to) started espousing them, Greek culture had already developed a preoccupation with ideals and abstractions. It was the *logos* and *aition* (in OBTF terms) that allowed philosophers like Pythagoras and Plato to be able to reify these imagined structures; it was the habit to *think* in those terms that made him able to \"see\" the light that he was chasing. It's like the old story about someone who spent years looking for a key in the dark of a room, when they simply only had to turn around to see the streetlamp outside that had been flickering and casting light all along.\n\n2. The Greek/Roman world was a **world** of values, rather than merely of objects and physical systems. It is because of this, rather, that ideas like *eudaimonia*, *phronesis* and *pr\u00f2sopon* are so fundamental to ancient Greek worldviews.\n\n3. Abrahamic worldviews don't have a lot of use for mindsets like that of the Socratic or Cynic, which is why Greek and Roman wisdom are so hard to align. If you're working on good works re. or for Adonai YHWH or Jesus or Allah, then a lot of what we associate with ancient Greek and Roman *phronesis* doesn't make a lot of sense. You have to be \"free\" in a certain sense to gain access to the answer; it's also not much of a surprise that a lot of Cynic philosophers tended to do pretty well in the Roman empire, where it's *much* easier to be free than in, for instance, the Levant, and where there are a lot of impressive displays and monuments to take in that you're totally free to traipse around in and enjoy at ease. *Phronesis* requires freedom.\n\n4. There was a strong tradition in Greece of seeing your culture through innocent eyes by writing from a totally different one. A lot of the idea behind Greek \"mimesis\" was to unpack cultural structures and processes by dramatizing them as if they were from a different world or time rather than accepting it as \"given.\" This is how archaic Greek myth sort of got straightened out, for instance: Homeric ballads were subjected to a series of epics recorded by authors like Hesiod and the Homeridae rather than just being obeyed because the bards were respected as vessels of this kind of specialized and esoteric wisdom.\n\n5. Greek culture in particular also had this strange bubble: Greek writers were much more reflective of and to their own culture than others were of Greece, especially in the Logioi themselves, who adopted a much less a-historical outlook than what you'd find in any subsequent philosophical context. So a lot of the \"pre-philosophy\" you can see asked questions from within the passive frame of reference of the object of attention; after Aristotle and Alexandrianism, though, philosophy becomes more reflective (see the tail of Leibniz's polymath index below for the decade in which he wrote papers about Heraclitus and the Sophists).\n\n6. A lot of the other ancient leades in philosophy might have been taken more literally by moderns if the mid-20th century wasn't such a hilarious time for academic units.

Ideology: One of the primary reasons why Nazi Germany treated Ukraine like a captured enemy is because of their ideology. The Nazi regime believed in a concept known as Lebensraum (\"living space\"), which involved expanding Germany's territory to provide more living space for its people. Ukraine was seen as a strategic location for this expansion due to its rich resources and agricultural potential. The Nazis also harbored animosity towards the Slavic peoples, including Ukrainians, whom they saw as an inferior race.\n\n2. Oppression: The Soviet Union, under the rule of Joseph Stalin, had subjected Ukraine to harsh oppression. Stalin's policy of collectivization had led to devastating famines, which caused the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. Additionally, the Soviet regime had brutally suppressed any form of dissent, including the peace movement known as the \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA). Many Ukrainians saw the invasion as a chance to rid themselves of this brutal oppression and establish an independent Ukraine.\n\n3. Propaganda: Nazi Germany used propaganda to persuade Ukrainians to support their regime. They claimed to be bringing about a new order in Ukraine, with promises of freedom, autonomy, and self-determination. The Nazis, however, had their own vision for Ukraine, which included forced Germanization, deportation, and enslavement.\n\n4. Resistance: Not all Ukrainians supported the Nazi regime. In fact, many Ukrainians opposed it and fought against German occupation. The UPA, as mentioned earlier, was one such resistance movement. The Soviet Union also played a role in the resistance, as they set up partisan units to fight against the Nazis. The resistance struggled against tremendous odds, as the Nazis had a vastly superior military force.\n\n5. The Holocaust: Nazi Germany carried out the Holocaust, which was the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews and other minorities deemed to be \"undesirable.\" This brutal campaign took the lives of millions of people, many of whom were Ukrainian Jews. The Holocaust is a dark chapter in Ukraine's history, and it is a stark reminder of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazi regime.\n\nIn summary, the reasons why Nazi Germany treated Ukraine like a captured enemy are complex and multifaceted. The ideology of Lebensraum, the Soviet Union's oppression, propaganda, resistance, and the Holocaust all played a role in the invasion. For most Ukrainians, however, the invasion was seen as a chance to throw off the chains of Soviet oppression and establish an independent Ukraine."}, {"question": "What is the case for Thomas Jefferson having fathered children by Sally Hemings?", "answer": "I'm probably going to break this down into a few more than three points!\n\n1) Samuel Melvin Meriwether, et al., *Jefferson and hemings: dueling biographies of two virginias* (NY, Hill and Wang, 1987): this is the major primary source for the Hemings/Jefferson marriage case, and the first (and still best) summary/explanation of it. Read this book, it is full of evidence and has possibly more primary sources on the case than anything out there.\n\nFor those who can't read the full thing, the conclusion is that Thomas Jefferson did, indeed, have a relationship(s) with his slave Hemings -- probably while she was in Turkey (pre-1786), when Jefferson was in France between 1787 and 1791, and may have done while abroad in France as well.\n\nPickers, Val N., ma: \"Jefferson and Hemings: Has the Case Changed?\" *Virginia Magazine* 101.1 (2002).

In this paper, the authors report on a chemical analysis of Jefferson family heritage, since the family is at heart a slave owning family.

DNA evidence: In 1998, a scientific study analyzed the DNA of descendants of both Jefferson and Hemings's male-line descendants. The results showed a genetic match between Jefferson's male-line male descendants and Hemings's male-line male descendants, indicating a strong probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one of Sally Hemings' children. (For more on this, see \"Thomas Jefferson's Children: Historical and DNA Evidence,\" a report compiled by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation and the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors and released in 1998.)\n\n2. Virginia law: At the time, Virginia law established that children born toslave women and white fathers were themselves born into slavery and were considered the property of their white fathers. Slaves could not legally marry, and any marriages or relationships between slaves and white people were not acknowledged by law. This would have left Thomas Jefferson open to legal and social repercussions if he had officially acknowledged Sally Hemings' children, such as being charged with \"fornication\" or being required to provide financial support for the children. Acknowledging the relationship and providing for the children's welfare secretly would have been much less risky for Jefferson.\n\n3. Historical evidence: Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings lived close to each other at his Monticello estate, and their relationship has been the subject of speculation for centuries. Jefferson's personal relationship with Hemings is hinted at in his papers, which include an entry in which Jefferson frets over how to arrange for the care of several of Hemings' children while he travels outside Barbados. Furthermore, two of Hemings' children were named after Jefferson and his wife, and one of them, Eston Hemings, was later freed by Jefferson's granddaughter and taken to France with her, providing additional evidence of a relationship between the two.\n\n4. Jefferson's reputation: Many historians argue that Jefferson's public reputation would have been severely damaged had he acknowledged the existence of children with a slave, while others contend it would not have greatly affected his political standing as a southerner who already owned hundreds of slaves. Regardless, it is likely that, for Jefferson, the growing number of Sally Hemings' children \u2014 at least six \u2014 and their increasing proximity to his family led him to feel a sense of responsibility for their welfare and compensation, given Virginia's laws regarding slave families. He is also believed to have provided Hemings with provisions and wages and noted that \"she has been faithful to me Twenty Eight Years... I have withheld her from a more base servitude to others... And I have protected her from the belt.\"\n\nCitation collected via The New York Times' archive, \"Jefferson Mentioned as Father of a Slave.\""}, {"question": "What is the historical background of the mormon prohibition on coffee? What was coffee's reputation among Joseph Smith's milleu during Mormonism's inception? Was it commonly believed to be an \"indulgent\" drink like alcohol, or was it viewed as we view it now?", "answer": "The Mormon prohibition comes down to a BLRM (Brigham Young, Last Man Standing) decision. Joseph Smith might have abhorred coffee (not so sure about tea), but there's not enough evidence to support a prohibition until well after his death. In fact there's good pickling evidence towards Joseph Smith regularly partaking in tea/coffee. \n\nThe First General Conference held in April of 1830 (before the Book of Mormon was even published) didn't address alcohol or tea/coffee directly. When it did come up in subsequent general conference, the prohibition was done in tentative fashion, often holding it as a [subject]([LINK] for 1832-34.\n\nTo put it simply, Joseph Smith only encouraged total abstininence because of the New Jerusalem. Exploring the \"Work of Abraham,\" Joseph Smith was doing a lot of theology about what the new society was going to be like. To him, this was an experimentation with elevating \"Zion\" into an ideal that could be transcribed on this earth. At the base of his vision was agriculture, for treating *all* faiths as scientific endeavors. \n\nThe thing was, coffee was profitable, not very dangerous and had delicious medical qualities (which lead, incidentally to more tobacco, not less). If it wasn't broken, what sort of utopia is Nauvooership anymore if every branch of the medical science doesn't explore for the next decade? Brigham's ban was a response to the economists taking over of Nauvoo city hall. \n\nThe late 1830s fell during the steam age, where inflation was running high. Hygiene and escorting women (to the standards of Iowa) was incredibly odd at the time. Businesses were running in a context where they weren't around \u201call the time,\u201d and people perform bets and business deals with exchange of goods. \n\nIn December of 1839, with the abolition of the Bank of the United States, Illinois also abolished their bank, and the United States is, in essence, in a transition period to the 23rd Amendment. Cities were, thus, implementing strict policy. \n\n\nMy professor tells me that agriculture plays a huge role in the sense of waste in the Atlantic states. Everyone needs food, and sometimes you waste bulk food. But in smaller states with more dense populace, coffee can be useful for giving religion to the poor. There isn't enough evidence to use Holly Bean coffee until one looks at the economic correlation with urban cities in the 1830s. Despite their initial disappointment of strong coffee, it eventually became acted upon with gentility after tentative bans going to righteous responsibility. Narcissists and conservative administrators pledged to the New Jerusalem still support their families, economy and city rights, because it acted relatively cheap, and protected social groups.\n\nCarpetbaggers weren't really around yet, and because it's an experiment in an agrarian society, nonbelievers understand that transgressing has \"social repercussions,\" even though personal health is downplayed.\n\nSo the fallacy of coffee comes about from, ultimately, Illinois policy dealing with the overturning of landmarks like National Bank and the deterioration of their land in 1838 (\u201cIt\u2019s a tumultuous time for them\u201d), which has implemented tentative prohibition, but hasn't acted upon all the industries yet. \n\nFeel free to ask me any further questions. I've tangentially studied under Ph.Ds that have work in 19th century Mormonism.", "baseline_answer": "During Joe Smith's time (early-mid 19th century), coffee was not commonly believed to be an \"indulgent\" drink like alcohol. In fact, coffee consumption was on the rise due to the discovery of new coffee plantations in Brazil and improvements in coffee production technology. Coffee was even being cultivated in the United States, with some plantations as far north as Connecticut and Massachusetts.\n\nThe reason for Mormonism's prohibition on coffee (along with tobacco and tea) is not well documented. Some believe that it was simply part of a broader health reform movement popular at the time, which also advocated for temperance and vegetarianism. Others suggest that it may have been part of a desire to distinguish Mormons from mainstream society, as drinking coffee and tea were common practices among non-Mormons.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the ban on coffee and other stimulants was linked to Smith's spiritual beliefs. In the Book of Mormon, sharpened senses and heightened spiritual perception are associated with being \"filled with the Spirit.\" By avoiding substances that could dull the senses, Mormons may have believed that they could better access these spiritual experiences. Additionally, Mormonism's emphasis on chastity and abstention from illicit substances may have led to the prohibition on coffee in the interest of clean living and moral purity.\n\nDespite early attempts to ban coffee in Mormon communities, it has never been an official doctrinal requirement of the church. Today, many Mormons (known officially as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) enjoy coffee and other caffeinated beverages without any moral qualms. However, Mormon\u201ds officially abstain from alcoholic beverages as part of their religious beliefs."}, {"question": "Why did Europe seem to develope faster technologically speaking as opposed to say Africa or Asia?", "answer": "For starters, it seems that the vast majority of historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, geographers, and other specialists have settled on the following general boat for geographic regions and done away with the broader continent categories:\n\n- **Eurasia**: Europe, the Middle East, Mideast (east of the Mediterranean), Southwest Asia, Central Asia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Caucasus. It's a bit separate from Europe, but still part of the Eurasian land masses along with Eastern Europe, etc.\n- **Africa**: the (containing) Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia (Middle East), Western Asia, Arab North Africa, the Maghreb (West Africa), Egypt, and West Africa. \n- **Asia**:  the Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, NE Iran (Afghanistan), Pakistan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, China (also includes Siberia), Mongolia, Korea, Japan. \n \nSo there you go, the Dark Continent gets somewhat traded in here for northwest Africa, etc. America, although a major continent, doesn't make the list. The reasoning is that some of the broader areas listed above don't fit well by just looking at North America, while to some extent everything on this list sorta does fit Europe.\n\nNow on to your questions!\n\n> More specifically, why did technology in Europe \"take off\" (forgive my lack of formalism) or seemingly develop faster than it did in Africa for example?\n\nWell, it seems there's varying conjectures whether Europe developed faster relative to others. Some modern *Euro*centric archaeologists and historians believe that Europeans transpacially and transtechnologically by embracing Siberia and Asia as part of a grand Eurasian genealogy, giving Europeans some sort of inherited trail of technological development. But this view may have a hard time explaining the failings or the successes of other cultures in Asia and Africa.\n\nSo then you have some archaeologists and historians affirming that Europe did develop faster than its neighbors not through a grater inheritance from Asia or Eurasia, but by embracing problems and developing a somewhat better solutions. Others point out that a two-pronged approach is necessary to truly explain Europe's earlier history in terms of it being \"advanced\" in technology and cultural knowledge of advanced technologies.\n\nGoing back a bit further I think it's better to look at Ancient Europe and how it interacted with others of the Eurasian world at the time. Using the political unit we have called the Roman Empire by Kenneth Harl in his book *[Cities of Salt, Sea Peoples and the End of the Bronze Age]([LINK]*, he makes an excellent case that the Russian' Siberian silver and Baltic Amber markets were highly profitable, bridging southern and eastern economies in exchange for whalebone, walrus ivory, and beaver, along with other northern goods. This glut of goods can changed the old course of the Roman Empire's northern frontier toward servicing a more September-Baltic-Sea economy instead of conquest. E.g. *[Liverpool, and Northern Europe in the Hanseatic Era]([LINK]*. Remember, the \"Hanseatic Circle\" centered on the North Sea, etc. As opposed to the old Roman frontier in Egypt.\n\nSo that's just one example of north-south exchange and expansion in Europe. We might say that from North-Africa to southern Europe, etc. These two-ways trade also helped to stabilize the North-South horizon of ancient and modern cultures, of which they innate tolerance for numerous religious ideas, characters and to some extent political principles.\n\nWhen you look inwards you're no doubt familiar with the fact that Europe is speckled with thick clusters of cave and rock art marking the way they though animals were hunted, forced down into fire, slaughtered, eaten, etc. And this onion-ringed gallery are called [earthworks]([LINK]*.

Historical Legacy: Europe had a unique historical legacy that provided the foundation for their technological advancement. Ancient Greek and Roman civilizations laid the groundwork for early scientific discoveries, and Medieval Europe witnessed the development of universities and guild systems that facilitated the transmission of scientific knowledge.\n\n2. Cultural Factors: European society placed a high value on individualism, innovation, and scientific inquiry, which further contributed to technological advancement. In contrast, Asian and African societies placed more value on tradition, conformity, and religious obedience.\n\n3. Geographic Factors: Europe's geography provided resources and opportunities for technological advancement. Protestantism emerged in Northern Europe, where agriculture and trade were more developed, providing a more favorable environment for technological innovation to thrive. Similarly, Northern Europe's proximity to the North Atlantic allowed for the development of oceanic trade networks and expanded commerce, leading to the accumulation of wealth and resources.\n\n4. Political Factors: The rise of nation-states in Europe following the Protestant Reformation and the establishment of constitutional governments facilitated the development of modern institutions, advanced infrastructure, and technological innovation. In contrast, traditional Asian and African societies tended to be more insular, with more authoritarian systems that discouraged innovation.\n\n5. Colonialism: European colonization played a significant role in accelerating technological advancement in Asia and Africa. Europeans introduced new technologies, such as firearms, printing press, and steam engines, which were of great value to non-European societies.\n\nThese factors, in addition to others such as expanding trade networks, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment, combined to provide Europe with a competitive edge in technological development compared to other continents during this time period."}, {"question": "In terms of resources, specifically oil, what did the Japanese hope to gain by starting a war with the US?", "answer": "There were some people in Japan who wanted to find alternative sources of fuel to reduce dependence on the United States and its petroleum products, but their thinking was not so grandiose as to believe that they could replace US fiat currency with comparable economic utility. The US had the capability to effectively scorch the earth in the Pacific and cut off all access through economic pressure - or with weapons of mass destruction - even as much as Japan hoped to persist into the California shore. The war with China, which had started thusly, had been for portions of China, not a National \"identity\" and its resources.\n\nWhat the Japanese had hoped was an end to American sanctions. The United States was against Japanese expansion. In the 1930(s), extending down to 138-139, Japan had set itself up on Manchuria, and in Korea, to push further. This was done on the basis of its concessions from the US under the Angell Treaty, which as a treaty exempts Japan from the Angell Empire's empire. Accordingly, Japan had a section of the globe it could look after, while Americans became blinded to the plight of others in the Orient. While Japan had 'aspirations,' they were primarily capitalists. Capitalists did not normally commit suicidal acts of harvest justice in the Orient.

They were able to defeat settled nations, tribes of nomads, Muslim armies, Christian armies headed by European lords and Japanese samurai armies. More pertinent to what we're discussing is the frequency and ferocity with which nomads assaulted settled nations regardless of it's ruling power. The nomads purposefully were present on your border or drove across steppes to assault fixed towns or cities, not just for the implyment of raiding goods and people within those borders, but to create panic and start wars.

Napoleon said \"Huns were to Rome as British were to Ottoman City of Siege.\" In a huns attack in 374 they mowed down the 8th century super army sent after them who had 110 000 men sent to kill them by saying \"The Roman force must either beat or retreat.\" When his other emperor made plans to win decisively against them that involved multiplying an army high beyond what the enemy held, he protested by saying \" to bring an army against them equal to our own would be to separate them out from each other.\"  the Huns employed a renewing system of horse archery tactical usage they seasoned Greeks and Romans alike repeatedly.\n\nWhile in case of Mongol nomads who at various times in conflict with settled peoples, similar types of tactics did exist among theirs. The famous Viking chief Rorik of Norway from rebellious Daneentrance status of being a well connected member of the Nordic royal family from middle-age and wartime had made a deal with king Alfred the Great of Wessex. They had established a similar truce that Huns and Seleukean vassals made. Withsets of Danish princes living with lords of British nobility and exchanged gifts, which would be unpleasant for Alfred to wage war on Danes on behalf of powerful Anglo-American entities he feared of corrupting his country to be Viking infested. However Alfred never could keep the unrest and war formally ended by making new military tactics, and potentially feared his military wasn't prepared unless they had motivation that they previously had and had them face a great threat in the late 10th-century empire of Khazaria.\n\nKhazaria had a similar tactical system with Bedouin nomads under Islamic rule. Huns were to Seleucus Empire what Huns were to the Roosevelt-Kennedy era. Regardless the Ottomans, Persians, and Arabic tribes staved off border raids with Mongols perpetually, the Mongols were there by 1249. Their power on Nomads that kept Khazaria safe was accounted off to mostly, if not all of it, their superior numbers and power of their nomadic army. So in the late 10th century - effects all nomadic peoples would attempt the same subsequently, Alfred ordered the construction of new barriers to prevent nomadic incursions using normal defense by muscling through barriers with strength, but mercifully regarding renounced nomadic power of subduing Rome with energy, confiscating spoils, and vanquishing the foe with convincing any superiors to this their power was more deadly than anything his country had.

Nomadic lifestyle and mobility: Unlike settled societies that had a sedentary lifestyle, steppe nomads like the Mongols could move their armies quickly and strike their enemies unexpectedly. This made it difficult for settled societies to prepare for or defend against their attacks.\n2. Skills in horsemanship and archery: The Mongols were exceptionally skilled horsemen and archers, which allowed them to attack from a distance and avoid direct combat with established armies. In addition, their mobility on horseback allowed them to easily move across large areas of open terrain, which contributed to their formidable reputation as conquerors.\n3. Psychological advantage: The Mongols were known for their terrifying tactics, like massacring civilians and leaving entire cities in ruins. These brutal methods terrorized their enemies and undermined their morale, which further contributed to their fearsome reputation and led to quicker surrenders or rebellions.\n4. Military innovations: The Mongols adopted new military technologies and tactics, such as the use of firearms and the construction of siege engines, that allowed them to overcome more established armies. This combination of technology, mobility, and fighting skills made them a major force to be reckoned with.\n5. Leadership and organization: The Mongols had strong leadership in the form of military generals like Genghis Khan, who united the nomadic tribes of the steppes and created a strong, centralized empire. This organization and discipline allowed them to implement their tactics and strategies effectively.\n\nAll of these factors combined to make steppe people like the Mongols a significant threat to settled societies. Their mobile, ruthless tactics, and innovations in warfare gave them a major advantage over their more settled enemies, which allowed them to quickly gain territory and enforce their will on the peoples they conquered."}, {"question": "Are there any good, comprehensive books on the Greek city-states BESIDES Sparta and Athens?", "answer": "1.

Both religions were polytheistic and featured intricate pantheons of gods and goddesses, but the names and attributes of these deities differed between the two cultures.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons worshipped a triad of major gods: Woden (Odin in Norse), Thunor (Donar in Norse), and Tiw (Tyr in Norse). Woden was the chief deity of the Anglo-Saxons and was associated with war, magic, and wisdom. Thunor was the god of thunder and related to fertility and prosperity. Tiw was the god of justice and honor.\n\nThe Norse religion also recognized these three deities, but they held different positions in the pantheon. Odin was still the chief god, but he was worshipped for his role as the god of wisdom, death, and the underworld. Donar was a less prominent figure in Norse mythology, and the Norse had their own god of justice, Forseti.\n\nThe mythology surrounding the deities was also different. For example, in Anglo-Saxon mythology, Woden was associated with the runic alphabet and was believed to have hanged himself from the world tree for nine days and nights to gain knowledge. In Norse mythology, Odin was similarly associated with the runes, but he hung himself in Frigga's garden, whereas in the Poetic Edda, he hanged himself from Yggdrasil, the world tree.\n\nBoth religions also used similar rituals and artifacts in worship. Anglo-Saxon pagans used runes, whereas Norse pagans used runes and the Elder Futhark alphabet. Both religions included animal and heathen sacrifices as part of their religious practices, though the methods differed.\n\nDespite these similarities, Anglo-Saxon and Norse mythology were distinct. The Anglo-Saxons also worshipped multiple goddesses, including Friga (Freya in Norse), a goddess of love, beauty, and fertility. The Norse had a more limited cast of goddesses, including Frigg (Freya in Anglo-Saxon mythology), Holda (Hel in Norse mythology), and Helja (Gullveig in Norse mythology).\n\nIn conclusion, there are recognizable similarities between Anglo-Saxon and Norse paganism, such as polytheistic pantheons and animal and heathen sacrifices.

I am from a french speaking population though)\n\nthe main reason why Anne of Britany ( who wasn't really granted her duchy like a reward, this duchy was attached to her position and title \"dukes of brittany\") was determined to keep Brittany wasn't independent of France because she didn't like french culture or was hostile to the union of the 2 crowns.\n\nFirst of all, motivated by her advisors and her own inclinations, and worried about having a weak national identity and being prone to invaison, Anne of Britany pushed further the process of self-legitimetation of the duchy in 1491, in order to prevent the french use of the Breton Marches and other pretensions by the monarchs of France. This took place during Renaud de Leu's episcopate (French bishop), who urged her to do so. He had been a fellow secretary of Jean du Mez, Abbot of Saint Paul de Le Mans, and poet, who had been requesting dismissal of the French nation from the duchy of Brittany in favour of the king [\"formidable magicien, formidable politique, remplissant de vigilance pour les affaires de Brittagne\"] as part of a very potent breton circle.

By the way, I have a book where I am bred with its very interestingness ; concerning texts and pictures you are welcome to send me other sources but I strongly suggest you to at least project the will of her guarantee from being dissolved in 1491, from the text written by her and french advisors (minus Derval who was born in Nantes) and of their time; is have that will been accomplished, or written by herself only, of being protested by the king, and if yes how, and if responded in a diplomatic or authoritarian opposition. As you can easily grasp I can't fully give you the answer because I don't have control over history. Until end of 15th century the response of Charles VIII was to engage upon a military war (which I couldn't care less to believe in with the lack of consumation of  its stated results) instead of signing a peace treaty during which lateron Anne of Britany has won over Charles VIII by the support of the breton common people and the reluctance from the instruction given by Charles VII and/or regents since the death of Charles VIII of reactionary kind in peaceful ways.wich sounds to me almost improbable since \"the will of the mickey mouse is stronger than the nations\" when it was revealed by results at the time, right?Well. Its not to say that it can never happen but also with you I don't know and I haven't researched it.\n\nIIring from that very point you must trace back Charles VII's refusal to Derval's assays at the court. He was unlikely the most famous judge in Bretagne having the social rank above burgbary's advisors though it is unclear to whether Charles VII quite responded to Derval positive or negative. That to say I haven't traced back but it is likely that Derval claimed on the first try he made during the election of Duke Affondes II in 1445 and that to say I have incredibly lot of debts to those who have traced that claim, for those trained as an historian. The remainder of it is accessible but nevertheless I find the claim in itself improbable.|assistant|>\nAfter Anne's death, King Charles VIII agreed to recognize her edict of 1491, which confirmed Brittany's independence from France. The edict included a number of conditions however, such as the surrender of Meneham and other strategic positions, that Brittany would maintain good relations with France, and that Anne's successor would continue to acknowledge France's suzerainty.

Historical and Cultural ties: Brittany had a distinct history and culture that had developed independently from France.

Economic Interests: The duchy was a wealthy region, and Anne knew that if it came under the control of the French crown, the taxes and revenue from Breton lands would be absorbed by France. This could threaten the economic fortunes of the duchy and harm the standard of living of Breton people.\n\n3. Political Realities: Anne was aware that the French crown was keen to absorb Brittany into its fold. She saw her role as a Breton duchess as an opportunity to defend the autonomy of her region from the larger ambitions of the French throne.\n\n4. Legacy: Anne was also conscious of her legacy. She was determined to leave a lasting mark on Breton history and secure her place as a protector of Breton interests. Maintaining the autonomy of her duchy would ensure that her name would be remembered as a champion of Breton independence.\n\nIn summary, Anne's determination to maintain the independence of Brittany was guided by a mix of cultural, economic, political, and personal reasons."}, {"question": "When the Hebrew language was being revived, why did they opt to use its original script as opposed to the already widespread Latin alphabet?", "answer": "1.

By using that script, modern Hebrew connects the revived language to its ancient roots and heritage. It also distinguishes Hebrew from other modern languages using the Latin alphabet. During the nineteenth century when Hebrew was being revived, there was a renewed interest in traditional Jewish culture and heritage, and preserving the Hebrew script was seen as an important part of that revival.

In some countries, such as Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, chopsticks were introduced by Chinese merchants or missionaries.\n\nChopsticks were chosen as a more practical eating implement than spoons and forks in Asia for several reasons:\n\n1. Cutlery was scarce: In ancient times, people didn't have access to metal products such as spoons, knives, and forks, which were expensive and difficult to make. Chopsticks, made from bamboo, were readily available and easily assembled without much fuss.\n\n2. Chopsticks were versatile: Chopsticks could be used to pick up a variety of foods, both solid and liquid, and were particularly useful for eating rice, noodles, and other dishes that required dexterity and flexibility. Spoons, on the other hand, were better suited for scooping soups and liquids.\n\n3. Chopsticks were hygienic: Eating with hands was common in ancient Asia, but it was also unsanitary due to bacteria and germs. Chopsticks provided a more hygienic alternative because they allowed people to eat without touching the food directly. Moreover, chopsticks were easier to clean than spoons or forks, as they could be gently rinsed or soaked in water.\n\nIn summary, chopsticks were invented as a practical alternative to spoons and forks in Asia due to the scarcity of cutlery, their versatility, and their hygienic benefits.

Some lords would have deigned it wicked dishonour to grant their household arms to any man holding a knight's spoor (heraldic devices are supposed to be far too specific and personal to grant one, and if the knight you're having married off to your daughter happens to lose his spoor in battle that screws up your genetic family history, didn't you know?), especially before the rise of professionalism in arms in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and those knightly families would remain their own.  This was an important part of social status, and also important for continuity of family history and family lands.  For example, in the Kingdom of Jerusalem (11th to 12th centuries), the baronial families by no means kept out of battle, but they kept their own families as and when needed to serve religious motivations or political alliances, while  in the War of the Roses, the two Lancastrian houses of Spencer and Douglas rebelled numerous times and it was Hary 'Hotspur' Percy who would serve with his own disgruntled but enormous family behind Henry IV.  While we don't have many examples of laymen adopting so blatantly their own heraldic device in a conflict, there certainly would have been knights, known as heralds-at-arms, who would have done so.  Such as William Paradys, who also famously appears fighting alongside the coat of arms of the Earl of Somerset during the Battle of Barutellon (11th Century Spain) while the earl is fighting somewhere near figotimes in central Spain.

Nothing really happens in the British standards of war in the 13th and 14th centuries without the eyes of antiquarians like Hardynge/Bumworth describing it, and the extant information to be found there is quite skimpy.  When the Dukes of Lancaster and York were in total war against each other in the Wars of the Roses, there seem to be no opposition with alliances as far as armorials are concerned, and it was said that at certain important victories, like the first battle of St Albans, the forces of the Yorkists displayed them eminently Sheriff's York, and if so, that was an adaption to the sophisticated armoured landscape of French warfare at extant in the 1300-ies, but was not really adopted by any nobles at all here until circa 1550.  There are certainly equals to this degree of armour in Mons (Belgium) and Antwerp regulars fighting alongside royal heraldry in the 15th century, and ironically this armorial was itself drowning in Anglo developments in the heraldic finery of terror throughout Jean du Biel 'Bastard of Anjou' and Jean du Fort of Marillac, who would exhibit the reign and firmatic credentials of their total continental military service in the thermocline of the Port of Dover in 1377, and then served Princess Margaret of Anjou's households in her company in England before her solidery against Wat Tyler and Henry VI as well as her bloody husband and adventures.  That was an alliance of people suspected of sinister papism.  That is something not new - it is why indeed battle was normalised in Christian culture since the Crusades, and the encirclement verified by knights decorating their bands in this heraldic religion on parades to various Crusader sites atlayed in a branch of French vice Mediterranean culture, about 30 miles from Normandy. \n Source:  Scholarly textbook 'An Explosion in Their Hearts.

While lords might encourage their vassals and retainers to incorporate elements of their own heraldry into their own designs, the individual knight or soldier would typically display their own unique coat of arms, known as a \"device\", on their armor, shield, and other equipment. This allowed for a visual display of identity and allegiance that transcended noble patronage, as well as providing a means of easy recognition on the battlefield. That being said, in some situations, such as during the knighting ceremony of a vassal or in certain parades and ceremonial processions, it was common for knights to wear the livery or colors of their lord as a symbol of fealty and allegiance. However, in the heat of battle, it was crucial for individual knights to be able to distinguish themselves and their own men from those of their enemies, which made the use of individual heraldry a practical necessity. Additionally, the costs of armor and equipment could be prohibitive, making it more economical for knights to refurbish and reuse old or inherited pieces rather than purchasing new ones, which further reinforced the use of personal designs."}, {"question": "Are there any examples of a battle being decided by single combat?", "answer": "As I understand it there a Greeks' culture was obsessed with single combat and duelling: it was identified as the epitome of manliness and courage (the reasons for this, an educated guess if I may say, lie in the fact that Greeks were very attached to aristocratic values of the family or lineage: family being defined as a group of people who could/did draw blood for their respective members' wounds, as well I guess the influence of Homeric epics). \nAncient Greek duels was of course organised based on an either free decision or follows the ways of honour between the opposing parties, like sending out a/the \"challenge\" or picking out a mercenary for dueling during a fight, and was a particular thing associated to aristocrats mainly tolerated or accepted by other aristocrats and, later on, wealthy families, meant to be decided by social status and indeed usually was decided based on said criteria joined with some military-/born trait (agility, strength, courage). \n\n\nYour first example is not a standard duel, if I remember well the brothers Oenomaus were presented as the foremost wrestlers of Lydia, as the Encyclop\u00e6dia of ancient history from Alexander Polyhistor reports.

A parcel of people here in this County adjudged to death, and before the sheriff or constables would come and take them away, rose suddenly with an ell of wood about twelve inches broad in every long hem three foot and a half or night, and so drove their sword- like whip betweeen their shoulders, till they could hardly be seen though there were a double hedge row (being of such stout stature) for all that while they would not give any way or yield a step.

Sabbath Observance: The Puritans believed that Saturdays and Sundays should be devoted entirely to religious activities, and that any form of work or business dealings should be avoided. However, as the colony began to grow, the necessity to engage in agriculture and commerce became overwhelming. The Puritans adopted a less stringent interpretation of the Sabbath, allowing farm work to be done on Sundays, as long as it was done with reverence and devotion to God. This compromise enabled the community to meet the demands of survival while still upholding the importance of religious observance.\n\n2. Church Membership: The Puritans believed that church membership was an essential step towards eternal salvation, and it was a shared responsibility of both the individual and the church community. However, as the colony grew, the number of congregants increased, making it difficult to maintain the intimacy and rigor of their congregational meetings. To address this issue, the Puritans established missionary churches, which were smaller and more manageable. This compromise enabled the Puritans to expand their community while ensuring that everyone had access to religious guidance.\n\n3. Purilance: The Puritans were known for their graveness, and they believed that any form of gaiety or frivolity was a grave sin. They discouraged music and dancing, as they believed that they could distract people from religious contemplation. This strictness led to a lack of social mixing and caused a sense of social isolation. However, the Puritans soon realized that they needed to strike a balance between piety and sociability to prevent a destructive psychological effect on their community. Consequently, they began to allow music and dance as a process of social integration. This compromise helped to cultivate the spirit of communal bonding in the colony.\n\nSources: \n\n1. Perry, D. B.

In Greek mythology, Persephone was the daughter of the harvest goddess Demeter and the ruling god Zeus. She was kidnapped by the god of the underworld, Hades, and taken to his kingdom. Demeter, grieving for her daughter's absence, caused a barren winter in the land. When Persephone finally agreed to spend part of the year with Hades, Demeter accepted it and allowed the world to come back to life during spring and summer.\n\nThis myth illustrates the cyclical nature of the seasons, in which life and growth are followed by decay and death, only to be replaced by new life. Ancient Greeks might have also seen this myth as a metaphor for the human experience of life, death, and rebirth, as people often face difficult times in their lives but eventually find new beginnings. Additionally, the myth reinforced the Greek belief that everything in nature and the world had a divine, supernatural dimension, which needed to be respected and revered. This myth also reflected the respect and significance that ancient Greeks attributed to women, as Persephone represented both fertility and power."}, {"question": "Foucault asserts that Medieval Christian thinkers took classical critiques/apprehensions of easy access to sex and intensified them, thus creating the Christian guilt surrounding sex and sexuality. Is this in line with current academic research?", "answer": "Yes and no. It would be more accurate to say that medieval people had their own *equally* strong critiques of sexual relations, which were influenced by Christian thought. Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179), for example, notes in her medical writings that men are particularly afflicted by illness when they experience excess sexual encounters, which she demonstrates with a whole range of symptoms:\n\n* \"Who becomes lustful and carnal, and moreover is not shy before others, and yet quivers before his wife; he is already infirm.\" \n* \"If he is prescribed to be blunt with food... marks on his back and from his navel down to his knees will appear; there will come humours, slime, and ulcerated great swellings full of corruption; these will make limbs suppurate; and there will come falls and collapse.\"\n* \"Troubling moistness (peculiar to vibrant redness and to heat) lodges seldom in the hands, but it tricks the bladder (as if nailing Christid, for so I interpret the words) 'and coughs and belches; and sudden impulses move the bladder\" \n* \"Desolved limbs, watery discharge therefrom, ensue: the forms rains from the veinous limbs; the most crushing fatigue does incontinence produce; the legs shake; there occur sprains; the knees shiver; there is sickness at the stomach...\"\n\nThere is a belief in some (all?) Muslim sources that the blood of conception is that of the man (*fatat\u0101 maruwwathu m\u0101 qat\u0101*), which reflects an early interest in what we today would describe as genetic heritage. Jurists also occasionally frowned upon too much friction between a wife's vulva and her spouse's penis, as this could introduce pathogens into the child that generated more pus, fever, night sweats, sickliness for a month or so, collapse in infancy, leprosy, hairy legs at childbirth, and/or pallor of the teeth.\n\nIn general, I would say that 1) excess sexual intercourse and/or weakness due to it were part of the Medieval lexicon for explaing  DNA, and 2) medieval people did not doubt their ability to do so. In contemporary medical and legal style of health writing (as well as analysis of the product of the premium/peasant interaction), it as important to going out drinking and vomiting too frequently or indulging in eating according to the joys of Heaven (such as olives & fragrant wine) as it was when it came to sexual allowances for a man. This is also my thought in relation to Foucault's views on sexual repudiation and ambivalence during the Middle Ages; that classical prose *forsye* space tends to concentrate on asexual and weakly sexual appeals towards a heteronormative, male-dominated, white readership. Women were not significantly encouraged to actively seek out sexual pleasures with men, otherwise they'd be punished, men who had venereal disease were shunned, and homosexual acts were often the cause of record qualities. By in large, people whom were encouraged to embrace sexual conduct for their well-being were men physically siphoning urine, doctors & alchemists for growing seed, *and purposely* abstinent women. Such men were under the authority of doctors, whether it be they themselves or in a different category of patients.\n\nDo not think that most Medieval people were incomprehensibly horrible or committing or appreciating of genocidal acts. There was in their theory the same pressure to naturally procreate as you can find in some Statistical sciences today about becoming mothers by your mid 30's or you're clunked with disappointment or other health concerns as you get older. This was also the all-destined fate of a woman: 'to plow a flax field.. to birth.. churn butter', or so on. A husband's baby could be damned by Allah, because it put an unnecessary strain on a woman's honor, particularly during the birth&nursing process.

Medieval Christian thinkers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, did indeed build on the classical condemnation of easy access to sex and intensified those critiques. For example, Augustine's influential work \"On Marriage and Concupiscence\" saw sexual desire, even within marriage, as a result of Original Sin and a source of temptation and sin. This perspective contributed to the development of Christian teachings on sexuality that continue to shape contemporary attitudes and beliefs. Current scholars analyzing Foucault's work, such as Roberto Esposito and Bonnie Wheeler, have further contributed to our understanding of how classical and Christian ideas intersected in the shaping of sexuality in the medieval and modern eras. However, some scholars, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros, have criticized Foucault's portrayal of medieval views of sexuality as too narrow, while others have questioned Foucault's neglect of non-Christian sexual traditions in his work. Nonetheless, Foucault's ideas continue to be a major influence in the study of the history of sexuality and its cultural and social significance."}, {"question": "Why were the spanish and Portuguese conquests successful?", "answer": "1. Christianity: Both Spain and Portugal have long been synonymous of Christianity, and to their conquest, early of religion was very effective. Machiavel in his Discourses on Livy writes that\n\n> \"The barbarians were conquered for their religion. For a people is more readily willing to undergo great effort for its religion than for its homeland alone and will more readily renounce their kingdom and homeland than their religion. \"\n\n\n2. Technology: I do not have to precisely perfect the technological gap that existed between the Portuguese and the Indians, or English/Spains with the Native American or Africans, however, we can simply take Caesar's invasion of Gaul as an example. In 52BC the Caesar  could invade Gaul and defeat the Gauls. According to the military historians the reason could be that the Gauls were not ready with iron clad armor and were killed without much troubles as their cities were being attacked in the night. This invading force, with a couple of Legias, cavalryy and baggage carriers defeated large Gaulish armies in a very quick time and conquered Gaul. While the European conquest was very easy compared to the successful conquest of say New Zealand, or Malaysia or Indochina. The weaponry and technological advancements that allowed an easy conquest. Portuguese had technically very superior ships than any other local people or colonies which allowed them to quickly transport men and resources.\n\n3. Navigation Equipment: The Portuguese had navigation equipment, a mariner compass especially that was excellent and many explorers could use it effectively to accurately navigate the waters. This was perhaps the most important feature that allowed them to conquer lands that other explorers could not. The Chinese explorer who around this time reached African coast was unable to reach Brazil in his voyage due to lack of a compass. However, by the time 1480s, Portuguese-equipped with the mariner compass, magnetic preservation and good maps were able to both go back to India and reach Brazil by the following year. Their continuous research of the ocean, the printing press and other new scientific discoveries allowed them to stay ahead and expand and conquer more than others.\n\n4. Artillery: They had artillery. That by itself made a huge impact any invasions. They could quell rebels, or induce rebellions in the conquered territories helped by them.\n\n5. Diplomacy: The Portuguese were very successful in diplomacy. They established good friendship with the Mughals and other large empires in South Asian, Indochina, Africa and America. They also purchased influence or gold from the local rulers. This is also one of the many thing that made the Portuguese successful.\n\n6. Huge Foreign Market Supply: Their empire, while small, certainly had contact with many of the world's big empires. When they conquered a country, an empire, they were fully prepared for dispatching people back to Europe with gold, spices, silk, densely packed with the sails full of men to work in the mines all over Central America and India all supported by Navigation equipment and ships. So, Portuguese, Spanish, and English had quick access to their final destination. Their empire was not the traditional empires that India or China had. They did not even have to send ships back to Portugal, it was allowed to sail to all the places that needed natural resources. Instead of sending back to Portugal and Britain, they were able to sell what they earned and then dispatch more again back to Europe quickly.\n\n7. Spirit of Adventure: Now this is not too hard to understand. When the explorers returned from New World, most were directed towards gold that could be found in the terr},\\ mesa and hills first all of the United States and then specifically, New World.

Disease: The spread of diseases like smallpox, which the Europeans brought with them, decimated the indigenous populations, weakening their resistance to conquest.\n\n3. Religion: Both Spanish and Portuguese soldiers were devoutly religious, which gave them a moral justification for their conquests, as they viewed themselves as spreading Christianity and \"civilization\" to the native populations.\n\n4. Strategic planning: The Spanish and Portuguese armies were led by skilled military commanders who employed effective strategy to conquer territories and resources.\n\n5. Economic incentives: The wealth of resources and strategic importance of the regions in question, such as gold, silver, spices, and prime navigational routes, made the conquests lucrative and offered significant economic rewards to the Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n6.

But, over the years, certain resources have emerged that have been particularly helpful.\n\nThere is no one preferred history of the Civil War era but many a history of that era has been published.  David Donald and George B. Tindall's *The Civil War and Reconstruction* series is very helpful.  [Webb Chapel and Lincoln's \"Second Inaugural\"][Webb Chapel & Linfoot's Inaugural] merits mention here.  But, as with many history courses, the most helpful texts are those that are least cited for their age or brevity.  Walter B Creaser's *The Manse and the Pulpit and the Ante Bellum Stage of the Presbyterian Church in America 1715-1865* (Bethlehem Press, 1910) is a helpful text, as is Stephen M.

Too, Minutes and Reports of Foreign Missions, and Early Presbyterian Missionary Journals, etc., all of them should be consulted as well.

Nearly two hundred English preachers -- such as, Septimus Tennyson, Charles Henry Doulton, D.G. Doulton, Doulton Knibb, George Horace Stevenson Baker (incl. Mayor of Phot via Skeke) and Charles Charteris -- may have something of interest. Preachers play a large role in the history of Civil War and Reconstruction, notably J.R. Handy. A service of worship in which the Pastor of Queen Street [J.R. Handy] explained the reasons for the taking of a Southern State into the Union may likely be helpful.  It would also be worthwhile for the discussion that Ordinations and Commissions are apt to elicit strong feelings, so Edgar Jenson's commissary address at September 26th, 1904 at New Bight may require consideration.\n\nThe 19th Century also appears to be a pivotal point in the avidity with which Reformed ministers are engaged with their respective church's history.

Is there any truth to that?", "answer": "This question picks up on a line that has been exaggerated for years. One of the major factors which began the critical analysis of Song China was the comparison it had with the rest of Europe during this period. This was something that first caught fire in Japan during this era when Japanese were looking at the various problems that they were facing in the evolution of their own society. Japan was traditionally a Chinese culture so the benefits were obvious in laying out certain causes and the Song era of China was looked at as the era in which the wheels of centralisation began to emerge. \n\nDuring the 19th century, Europeans began to compare the pre-Ming and pre-Song era of China with their own history and found that ideas in China had advanced their own understanding locally in terms of science, mathematics, economics etc. In the case of Japan this would prove quite fruitful with the presence of both an educated populace and an imperial bureaucracy with promise as far as they were concerned. \n\nThe Song period of China would offer Europeans certain assets. The necessity for printed multi-colour text illustration for example was defined around this point in time. Paper was relatively cheap despite the need for further development in the bleaching of the fibres but the growth in population, mainly during the 9th century and the ascension of the Song, brought an advanced level of literacy which required social resistance or entertainments to delimit the books which needed cheap prints. When monks in Japan were hand parsing Holy Bible's on hand painted scrolls, a quarter of Japan could read and had read. *Shinichi Hisamoto, Religion* 1 starts.\n\nBy the 13th century, a quarter billion people comprised a literate populace which, by then, was valued by the emperors and the feet of the scholars who progressed these texts. The life of the Song era \u300a\u79e6\u723e\u5ba4\u591a\u7fa9\u8981\u0440\u043e\u0435\u300bwrites that scholars had to acquire diplomas before the age of 10 and the lives of scholars depicted, by the advent of American scholarship, music as a defining element. These lives were written as Taiwanese tradition series \u300a\u9133\u9580\u53e4\u6587\u5b78\u8a18\u300btoday, one which may suit your study on music for the  Song. The depiction of the army archer \u738b\u6558 by Kong Shangren at this juncture was absolutely heralded -- with several translations of the poem -- and rooted in the depictions of other writers of the time. The overarching idea here is that the music official was levelled with.

The women scholars known as the last charm that his fingers solely perform before piercing the bulging eyes lids. That process was represented by the finger crops which began on this period. There was conflict over the processes of the schollar's finger crops to allow these processes through. *Mei Zhiwu (2014) pages 57\u201360* \n\nTo what end silence through humiliation had to be translated for the taoyan. Appendices in Song schematics \u300a\u5927\u79e6\u9293\u300bcontained songs yet these were too erudite for the mass public. The power of tradition to translate \u8005\u4e4b\u4e03\u8a00 Song schemes depict that a substantive knowledge of music was integrated. Petitions were common at that point in time -- wide seven and ten l\u00eeng (5.3 liter) petitions -- yet used also for the music official of Japan. Very royal seal often during the twilight years of a lot of the glories of Song revealed the music official (or as it was known a Director for Musical performances better resembling the [Nahka]([LINK] for Ancient Egypt).

Turkey didn't accept a total of nine mandated territories that were granted to France, Italy, Britain, and Greece. The territories were occupied with foreign troops and Turkey had no real influence on the occupied lands as they strongly believed it was done to enable European powers to control the Straits.\n\n2. Greece weren't granted 20% of Asiatic Turkey's population and 50% of trade in Anatolia and the Mediterranean. \n\n3. Turkey were given control of the Dodecanese islands instead of it falling to Italy.\n\n\n\nThe Treaty of Sevres was initially hailed as a great sign of power by France and their allies in the war.  France wasn't punished by the Treaty of Versailles and as a result didn't have to make such a set-back.  And the treaty would put Turkey in an extremely weak position, having lost more then 75% of it's territory and having major parts of it's population living under foreign control. Harming the Ottomans was one of their primary goals during the war.\n\nAs for why the treaty was rejected: \n\nThe Turkish soldiers who fought during the war were aware that Sevres was extremely harsh and make it a very strong impetus to fight for independence.  There was absolutely no way they'd sit and accept such a treaty or become rulers under those conditions. The three main leaders who rejected the treaty - the Grand Sheikh of the Nur leader (Abdul Rahman); the Kemal Atat\u00fcrk (leader of the Nationalists), and the Turkish Nationalist leaders - all agreed that they needed to reject the treaty. According to them, rejecting the treaty would not immediately result in revolution that would end WW1 for Turkey, but it would be a political decision to oppose the French imposed ruler and what they called (at the time some evidence of the leaders didn't support the idea of a *additional* National State).\n\nFor the French, there was always a threat that the Turkish government would completely reject the Treaty of Sevres after the international situation regulated (mainly completely during WW1 after they both joined with the Central Powers). Turkey still controlled large swathes of the Empire, and there were plenty of former leaders left as well. So the French put moderately more conditions on 'is' governments and it was almost an absolute that promises were made if the oppositions would be permitted to join. And so the French not only had to fight the Nationalists, but also a multi faction coalition made up of the Central Powers and former leader's hold on Turkish supporters.  \n\nReflecting for a moment, the treaty was so heavily disproportioned that it effectively bit any amount they got out of Turkey. They got large portions of peoples and wealth from the Eastern side of the Straits and Constantinople. To almost make up for that, they got rid of powerful long-term (and effective) Turkish enemies and allowed new Ottoman armies to reform and grow, which they would fight stronger than any European army during the remaining years of WW1.  That being said, with regards to the situation and power organisation, there wasn't anything better being offered to the French, despite the passing of another agreement under French making the conquest of Istanbul (albeit the Ottoman Empire at the time) more difficult then it would be at that point. The French plan to drastically reduce the troops in return profits from conscription and got lands were conditions required for Foreign leader acceptance of Sevres but was passed-away with Feisal's British Mandate in India. Much interest came and went in various states about the changes, but rumors of the French setting their goals much more humane than the Treaty of Sevres for the minor powers fueled by the rejection of its base in Turkey led them to retract what, from their perspective, the  Independent Turkish leader had before. It is highly improbable that Turkey would have anything considered more favorable than Sevres because the war required the modernization and shrinking up of the Ottoman state for the prime powers to be able to maneuver and develop infrastructure in (the railroads an example).  By reducing the governmental power and gaining a bit of trade, it was likely more favorable for France then a possible combination without leaving themselves with", "baseline_answer": "The Ottoman Empire was able to reject the Treaty of Sevres and later sign a treaty with more favorable conditions for several reasons:\n\n1. The Treaty of Sevres was imposed on the Ottoman Empire following their defeat in World War I. However, the Turks were able to mount a successful resistance against the occupying Allied forces led by Atat\u00fcrk in the Turkish War of Independence. This led to the defeat of the Allies and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which was more favorable to the Ottoman Empire.\n\n2. The Treaty of Sevres inflicted harsh economic and territorial losses on the Ottoman Empire. It imposed high reparations, dismantled the Ottoman army, and decimated Ottoman territory. This treaty was deeply unpopular among the Turks, and Atat\u00fcrk used nationalist sentiment to rally support for the Turkish War of Independence.\n\n3. The Allies were facing economic and political turmoil following World War I, making them less inclined to pursue their goals in the Middle East. The Treaty of Lausanne was signed at a time when the Allies were eager to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict and avoid further global turmoil.\n\n4. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the boundaries of the modern Republic of Turkey as they exist today. It restored some former Ottoman territories and allowed Turkey to keep its capital in Istanbul. This was a significant improvement from the harsh conditions imposed by the Treaty of Sevres.\n\nOverall, the rejection of the Treaty of Sevres and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne was a major success for the Ottoman Empire under Atat\u00fcrk's leadership, as it allowed Turkey to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity."}, {"question": "Since 1986 the UN has organized the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery. Was the USA ever condemned for its [ongoing] usage of slavery via the 13th Amendment?", "answer": "Yes, the United States was repeatedly condemned for its ongoing usage of slavery via the 13th Amendment by the United Nations until it was accepted as a solved issue. Firstly in the General Assembly, and later in the Human Rights Council. Such condemnations happened on an annual basis. \n\nMore specifically, [an UN Human Rights report] published in 2001 found that the system of mass imprisonment of African-American men violated the prohibition on forced labor contained in the 13th amendment. The report recognized that imprisonment \"by its very nature is a violation of all human rights. It curtails, restricts or takes away, fundamental human rights and liberties and affects, negatively, all other rights.\" The United States in response quashed its criticism through its allies like the UK and Australia. A British spokesman at the Council said that while the United States has some \"very big, historic\" problems in implementing human rights domestically, \"we do not believe that we should discredit the United States or the council's procedure of examining human rights\" by focusing on problems in the US'.\n\nThis is noted by the same [UN report]([link] in the 14th chapter.\n\nOverall, the United States is an attractive target for condemnation due to its significance of power but also because at its inception it was seen as an affront to human freedom and rights.

This exception allows for the continued use of prisoner labor in some cases. In international law, slavery is defined as \"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attattaching to the right of ownership are exercised\" (United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking). While the use of prison labor might raise concerns under this definition, the U.S. Government maintains that it is a legitimate penal practice and not a form of slavery.\n\nThere have been some critical evaluations of the continued use of prisoner labor in the United States, but the UN has not formally condemned the practice as a violation of international law. The UN has, however, called on countries to eliminate any exploitative labor practices, including those involving prisoners, as part of its efforts to combat forced labor and human trafficking.\n\n[Note: UN bodies have criticized the U.S. For other human rights issues, such as the use of the death penalty and the Guardian ad Litem program in child custody cases, as documented in their periodic reviews of U.S.'s compliance with international human rights treaties.]"}, {"question": "What powers did Jefferson Davis have being that he was president of the confederate states?", "answer": "Although some will quibble in the comments about the *legitimacy* of his position, six answers basically cover it all.\n\nBetween the five answers that just reference Wikipedia, the phrasing of [Staoshav's]([LINK] is particularly terrific*: \"By the end of the Civil War, the Confederate constitution had existed for a paltry two years before Davis began to extend his war powers to the distance that VP Hampton (i.e., proper constitutional literature) ever did when he wrote his Consitution of the Confederate States of America.\"\n\n*FYI: The percentage of I-am-AskingHISTORY! quesion and answer divisions that from time to the time of my discharge in August have just the answer in the title reads 12.328437%, ending on August 17, 2019.

Now I remember some things being made out of gold yesterday,  or this is partially a memory issue on my end, so I might not be answering your question comprehensively. However, in one account, the Wetzstein von Kennaltaube, there is this iron axe with gold mounts - and that's how it's linked since iron is not nearly as rare historically as gold, and you would not normally think: Why does this axe have gold in it?\n\nAt the very beginning of the bronze age in Central Europe there was a site in Fortsetz al Zwenkau, where they have gold objects again in great multitude, through about 50 kg of gold within 200 individual items bearing gold threading/sheetings. Remarkably too, it is also here that the ratio of gold to other metals is changed from the bronze to the iron age era. So to another degree, I thought gold was replaced by bronze in the same way iron replaced bronze, but it might have been more a link between the bronze and the iron ages globally.\n\nRather, it would appear that one of the few earlier disappearing uses of gold is to decorate bridles, chariots and ridden animals. Things for battle and athletics persisted into the historical age probably due to a 'traditional' reason, but as soon as stricter accuracy in our sources comes through, gold also gets replaced by silver, copper, brass and tin coated objects.\n\nI have also seen sagas and such, that kinda sorta imply a sort of standard of value with gold, but I doubt such *ancient* texts were meant to be entirely demonstrably correct economically over centuries.", "baseline_answer": "1.

Today, gold is still used in medicine for various purposes such as treating arthritis, alleviating depression, and inhibiting cancer cell growth.\n\n3.

In fact, it continued to spread and evolve in the post-war era for several reasons:\n\n1. Historical anti-Semitism: Anti-Semitic beliefs have been a part of European and Western cultures for centuries. The Holocaust did not eliminate these beliefs, and many people continued to harbor deep-seated prejudices against Jews. The theory that Jews control the media provided a convenient explanation for perceived Jewish influence in popular culture and politics.\n\n2. Political instability: The post-war era was marked by political instability and social upheaval, with many social and political norms being challenged. During this time, the media became an increasingly important source of news and information. Some people, particularly those on the right-wing, saw this as a threat to traditional values and perceived Jews as the driving force behind this change.\n\n3.

One of these rabbis is Rabbi Yaakov from Jessnitz (Jezna) in modern-day Poland, who miraculously escaped from his Egyptian imprisonment during the Mamluk period and made his way to Jessnitz just as the Ottoman Sultan sent an envoy to Jessnitz during the Ottoman conquests of Poland to request the right hand of Rabbi Yaakov as a valuable contribution to his conquests. Rabbi Yaakov continued life and scholarship in Jessnitz, after his imprisonment in Egypt, but the price of his involvement in the Mamluk-Ottoman conflicts was his summary execution by Queen Catherine the Great's police.\n\nSecondly, Eastern Orthodox Muslim Turks have, as of my knowledge, developed an interest in Christianity, as much for linguistic affinity against Arabic-identified Muslims (as well as German occupation language), as for enquiries about pre-Ottoman Eastern European Christians. This interest in Christianity as a harbinger against Arabic-identified Muslims comes in part from the fact that many Slav people converted to Judaism and to Christianity from Arabic-identified Muslim authorities during the early periods of Islamization of Eastern Europe. The term \"Vlach\" for the Slav Christians from the territory and language of Eastern Serbia and Eastern Bulgaria was roughly a synonym for \"sheep\" and was the name of Serbian slave merchant shepherds in Candia ( istanbul) who ran the port's businesses during this period. The name was applied to the ancients Slav Scythians, as well. Many other names in Eastern Europe were preserved, like Cuman (\"Turk of the Hungering Steppes\"), Bukarian, Volga Tatar, or the Kazan Tatars.\n\nIn short, Eastern Orthodox Muslims may be interested in pre-Ottoman Eastern European religions and cultural heritage in properly conducting their linguistic study into their major targets like Brotherhood Movement, Balkan Muslim Brotherhood Society or British-German Istanbul Bible Society - from which modern Turkish Christians mainly come, or in conducting International conversation with supposed Eastern Turks and local Christians from Eastern Europe.\n\nAt this point of time, Slavic Afro-Asiatic Linguistics are rare to encounter. However, as the causes for these ancient relations between Turks (Slavs, Semites) and Europeans (probably mostly Egyptians and Libyans) are left uncertain to-date, one may suggest that the constant migrations through the territories of the Great Rift Valley of Africa are never a result of that ancient turmoil when the Arab, Berber and Egyptian people shared ancient Semitic blood and a multitude of Cushitic, Nilotic and other related indigenous Ancestral African bloods to enslave, subjugate and fuse within an addressive capability of 10 years to enslave and subjugate Christian Berber to Christian Moroccan Arab.\n\nThe studies around The Slave Identities in the Arab Mediterranean Is a typical Havas Agriculture X Arey name in this context that can help speed up and secure the enfranchisement of the descendants of the Black Slaves in America.
